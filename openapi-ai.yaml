        Returns an approximate count of ticket activities in the last 30 days affecting the agent making the request. If the count exceeds 100,000, the count will return a cached result. This cached result will update every 24 hours.

        The `count[refreshed_at]` property is a timestamp that indicates when the count was last updated.

        **Note**: When the count exceeds 100,000, `count[refreshed_at]` may occasionally be null.
        This indicates that the count is being updated in the background, and `count[value]` is limited to 100,000 until the update is complete.

        | Name | Type   | Max chars | Mandatory | Comments
        |----- | ------ |---------- |---------- |-----------
        | type | string | 255       | yes       | Globally unique type identifier defined by the integration origin service. Examples: a GUID or URI
        | data | string | 65535     | yes       | JSON data containing display hints

        #### fields array

        The `fields` array lists ticket fields to set in Zendesk and their values. Each item consists of a field identifier (`id`) and a value (`value`) for the field. For Zendesk system fields such as `subject`, the identifier is the English name. For custom fields, the identifier may be a field ID or a name. See [Ticket Fields](/api-reference/ticketing/tickets/ticket_fields/).

        The `fields` array can only set ticket values on ticket creation, not on ticket updates.

        #### Response format

        The response is a JSON object containing a single key:

        | Name      | Type     | Comments
        | --------- | -------- | -------------------
        | results   | array    | An array of [result objects](#result-object)

        The `results` array contains an entry for each item in the incoming `external_resources` array, in the
        same order.  For example, if you call `push` with 3 external resources, a successful response will include

      description: |
        Updates an automation.

        Updated automations must be unique and have at least one condition that is true only once or an action that nullifies at least one of the conditions. Active automations can have overlapping conditions but can't be identical.

        The request must include the following conditions in the `all` array:
        - At least one time-based condition
        - At least one condition that checks one of the following fields: 'status', 'type', 'group_id', 'assignee_id', or 'requester_id'

        **Note**: Updating a condition or action updates both the `conditions` and `actions` arrays, clearing all existing values of both arrays. Include all your conditions and actions when updating any condition or action.
        **Note**: You might be restricted from updating some default automations.

        ### Creating tickets

        #### Introduction

        Creating tickets using Talk Partner Edition follows the same conventions as the Create Ticket endpoint. See [Create Ticket](/api-reference/ticketing/tickets/tickets/#create-ticket).

        #### Request parameters

        The POST request takes a mandatory `ticket` object that lists the values to set when the ticket is created.
        You may also include an optional `display_to_agent` value such as the ID of the agent that will see the newly created ticket.
        The `display_to_agent` is validated before creating the ticket, returning a 422 error if it is invalid.

        Tickets created using this endpoint must have a `via_id` parameter. See the following
        section for possible values.

        #### Zendesk Talk Integration Via IDs

        Tickets created using this endpoint must have one of the following `via_id` parameters:

        | ID       | Description
        | ---------| -------------
        | 44       | Voicemail
        | 45       | Phone call (inbound)
        | 46       | Phone call (outbound)

        ### Creating voicemail tickets
        #### Request parameters

        The POST request takes a mandatory `ticket` object that lists the values to set when the ticket is created.
        The ticket must have a `voice_comment` with the following values:

        | Name               | Type                  | Comment
        | ------------------ | ----------------------| -------

        | call_duration      | integer               | Duration in seconds of the call
        | answered_by_id     | integer               | The agent who answered the call
        | transcription_text | string                | Transcription of the call (optional)

        * The `key` property cannot be updated

        * The `properties` parameter is comprised of four parts and can't be changed if any records exist for the object.
            * `autoincrement_enabled`: A Boolean that enables and disables autonumbering. Must be false if is_unique is true.
            * `autoincrement_prefix`: A string value that is used as a prefix to the autogenerated numbers. It can't exceed 30 characters.
            * `autoincrement_padding`: An integer specifying the starting number of digits in the autogenerated numbers. This value may be between 0-9. However, if you create records in excess of of these digits, additional digits are added as necessary.
            * `autoincrement_next_sequence`: An integer that will be used as the next number in the autonumbering sequence. It can't be negative or less than the current autonumbering value.
            * `is_unique`: A Boolean that enforces uniqueness for manually entered record names. When true, custom object record names must be unique. Must be false if autoincrement_enabled is true.

            * For an `"update"` action, an array of JSON objects representing the custom object records being updated

        Note: If autonumbering is selected for the custom object's name field, record names aren't allowed in the request body because they are generated automatically. If uniqueness is enabled, the record names must be unique.

            Fuzzy search is supported for the following text-based field types: : Text fields, Multi Line Text fields, and RegExp fields.<br/><br/>

            For example, you might want to search for records related to Tesla vehicles: `query=Tesla`. In this example the API would return every record for the given custom object where any of the supported text fields contain the word 'Tesla'.<br/><br/>

            You can include multiple words or numbers in your search. For example: `query=Tesla Honda 2020`. This search phrase would be URL encoded as `query=Tesla%20Honda%202020` and return every record for the custom object for which any of the supported text fields contained 'Tesla', 'Honda', or '2020'.

      summary: Filtered Search of Custom Object Records
      description: |-
        Returns an array of custom object records that meet the search and filter criteria.

        Filters can contain either an individual [comparison object](#comparison-object) or an array of [comparison objects](#comparison-object) within logical namespaces.

        A filter is a JSON object that has the following properties:

        | Name      | Type   | Required | Description
        | --------- | ------ | -------- | -----------
        | ATTRIBUTE | object | no       | A [comparison object](#comparison-object) specifying an attribute value condition to be met for records to match.<br/><br/>Examples are marked below.
        | $and      | array  | no       | Array of conjunctive filter objects (logical AND)
        | $or       | array  | no       | Array of conjunctive filter objects (logical OR)

        ##### Examples


        ```js
        {
          "filter": {
            "custom_object_fields.field_key": { "$eq": "value" } // ATTRIBUTE
          }
        }
        ```

        ```js
        // $or
        {
          "filter": {
            "$or": [
              { "custom_object_fields.field_key": { "$eq": "value" } }, // ATTRIBUTE
              { "external_id": { "$eq": "Record123" } } // ATTRIBUTE
            ]
          }
        }
        ```

        #### Comparison Object

        A comparison object defines a condition a record must meet to be considered a match. The condition is based on an attribute value or object type.

        A comparison object is a JSON object that has the following properties:

        | Name      | Type          | Required | Description
        | --------- | ------------- | -------- | -----------
        | FIELD_KEY | string        | yes      | When filtering on a custom field, they must be namedspaced with `custom_object_fields.`. ex. `custom_object_fields.field_key`<br/><br/>When filtering on a standard field, no namespace is required. The following fields are considered standard: `created_at`, `updated_at`, `created_by_user`, `updated_by_user`, `name`, `external_id`
        | OPERATOR  | string        | yes      | [Supported operators](/documentation/custom-data/v2/searching-custom-object-records/) vary by the value's data type
        | VALUE     | string, array | yes      | The value you're filtering for

        #### Allowed For

        * Administrators
        * Agents in custom roles with the `manage_triggers` permission (Enterprise only)

        #### Request Parameters

        The PUT request expects a `triggers` object that lists the object triggers to update. All of the specified object trigger `ids` must be associated with a single object.

        You can specify the following properties for each object trigger you're updating:

        | Name        | Mandatory | Description
        | --------    | --------- | -----------
        | id          | yes       | The ID of the object trigger to update
        | position    | no        | The new position of the object trigger
        | active      | no        | The active status of the object trigger (true or false)

        #### Example Request

        ```js
        {
          "triggers": [
            {"id": 25, "position": 3},
            {"id": 23, "active": true},
            {"id": 27, "position": 9, "active": false},
            {"id": 22, "position": 7}

        in the Zendesk GDPR docs. To soft delete a ticket, use the [Delete Ticket](#delete-ticket) endpoint.

        This endpoint enqueues a ticket deletion job and returns a payload with the jobs status.

        If the job succeeds, the ticket is permanently deleted. This operation can't be undone.

        This endpoint returns a `job_status` [JSON object](/api-reference/ticketing/ticket-management/job_statuses/#json-format) and queues a background job to do the work.
        Use the [Show Job Status](/api-reference/ticketing/ticket-management/job_statuses/#show-job-status) endpoint to check for the job's completion.

        in the Zendesk GDPR docs. To soft delete tickets, use the [Bulk Delete Tickets](#bulk-delete-tickets) endpoint.

        This endpoint accepts a comma-separated list of up to 100 ticket ids. It enqueues
        a ticket deletion job and returns a payload with the jobs status.

        If one ticket fails to be deleted, the endpoint still attempts to delete the others. If the job succeeds,
        the tickets that were successfully deleted are permanently deleted. This operation can't be undone.

        This endpoint returns a `job_status` [JSON object](/api-reference/ticketing/ticket-management/job_statuses/#json-format) and queues a background job to do the work. Use the [Show Job Status](/api-reference/ticketing/ticket-management/job_statuses/#show-job-status) endpoint to check for the job's completion. Only a certain number of jobs can be queued or running at the same time. See [Job limit](/api-reference/introduction/rate-limits/#job-limit) for more information.

        WARNING: Permanently deleting a user deletes all of their information. This information is not recoverable.

        #### Permanent user deletion rate limit

        You can permanently delete 700 users every 10 minutes.
        The rate limiting mechanism behaves as described in
        [Rates Limits](/api-reference/introduction/rate-limits/#monitoring-your-request-activity) in the API introduction.
        Zendesk recommends that you obey the Retry-After header values.

        #### Pagination

        By default, a maximum of 100 email notifications are included per page. Use cursor-based pagination parameters (`page[after]` and `page[before]`) to navigate the records (can't be used together in the same request). See [Pagination](/api-reference/introduction/pagination/) for more details.

        * Limit items per-page: `api/v2/email_notifications.json?page[size]=25`

        * Retrieve previous page: `api/v2/email_notifications.json?page[size]=25&page[before]=yyy`

        The values `xxx` and `yyy` are placeholder values that represent cursors.

        #### Sorting

        By default, email notifications are sorted by creation time (newest first). The query parameter is not supported for this endpoint.

        * By creation time (oldest first): `api/v2/email_notifications.json?sort=created_at`

        The `refreshed_at` property of the `count` object is a timestamp that indicates when the count was last updated.

        **Note**: When the count exceeds 100,000, `refreshed_at` may occasionally be null. This indicates that the count is being updated in the background, and the `value` property of the `count` object is limited to 100,000 until the update is complete.

        Use this endpoint to test the incremental export format. It's more strict in terms of rate limiting,
        at 10 requests per 20 minutes instead of 10 requests per minute. It also returns only up to 50
        results per request. Otherwise, it's identical to the above APIs.

        Use the `incremental_resource` parameter to specify the resource. Possible values are "tickets", "ticket_events", "users", or "organizations".

      description: |
        Returns a stream of changes that occurred on tickets, excluding events occuring within one minute of the request. Each event is tied
        to an update on a ticket and contains all the fields that were updated in that
        change. For more information, see:

        - [Exporting ticket events](/documentation/ticketing/managing-tickets/using-the-incremental-export-api#exporting-ticket-events) in [Using the Incremental Exports API](/documentation/ticketing/managing-tickets/using-the-incremental-export-api)

        You can include comments in the event stream by using the `comment_events`
        sideload. See Sideloading below. If you don't specify the sideload, any comment
        present in the ticket update is described only by Boolean `comment_present`
        and `comment_public` object properties in the event's `child_events` array.
        The comment itself is not included.

        #### Allowed For

        #### Sideloading

        The endpoint supports the `comment_events` sideload. Any comment present in the ticket
        update is listed as an object in the event's `child_events` array. Example:

        ```js
        "child_events": [
          {
            "id": 91048994488,

        Cursor pagination returns a maximum of 100 records per page. Events are listed in chronological order.

        If the results are not paginated, events will be returned as a time-based incremental export.

        Returns the tickets that changed since the start time. For more information,
        see [Exporting tickets](/documentation/ticketing/managing-tickets/using-the-incremental-export-api#exporting-tickets) in [Using the Incremental Exports API](/documentation/ticketing/managing-tickets/using-the-incremental-export-api).

        This endpoint supports time-based incremental exports.
        For more information, see [Time-based incremental exports](/documentation/ticketing/managing-tickets/using-the-incremental-export-api#time-based-incremental-exports) in [Using the Incremental Exports API](/documentation/ticketing/managing-tickets/using-the-incremental-export-api). You can also return tickets using cursor-based pagination. See [Incremental Ticket Export, Cursor Based](#incremental-ticket-export-cursor-based).

        The results include tickets that were updated by the system. See
        [Excluding system-updated tickets](/documentation/ticketing/managing-tickets/using-the-incremental-export-api#excluding-system-updated-tickets-time-based-exports) in [Using the Incremental Exports API](/documentation/ticketing/managing-tickets/using-the-incremental-export-api).

        The endpoint can return tickets with an `updated_at` time that's earlier than the
        `start_time` time. The reason is that the API compares the `start_time` with the ticket's
        `generated_timestamp` value, not its `updated_at` value. The `updated_at` value is
        updated only if the update generates a [ticket event](#incremental-ticket-event-export).
        The `generated_timestamp` value is updated for all ticket updates, including system
        updates. If a system update occurs after a ticket event, the unchanged
        `updated_at` time will become earlier relative to the updated `generated_timestamp`
        time.

      description: |
        Returns an OAuth access token with a specified [scope](#scopes).

        Refresh tokens aren't used. An access token doesn't expire but it can be [revoked](#revoke-token).

        For a tutorial, see [Creating and using OAuth tokens with the API](/documentation/ticketing/working-with-oauth/creating-and-using-oauth-tokens-with-the-api/).

        **Note**: For OAuth authorization code, use the [Create Token for Grant Type](/api-reference/ticketing/oauth/grant_type_tokens/#create-token-for-grant-type) endpoint.
        The two APIs don't share the same path, JSON format, or request parameters. However, both APIs return access tokens that can be used to [authenticate API requests](/api-reference/ticketing/introduction/#oauth-access-token).

        #### Allowed For

        * Admins

        #### Request parameters

        The POST request takes a "token" object that contains an OAuth client's resource id and scopes.

        | Name      | Type    | Description
        | --------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------
        | client_id | integer | The resource `id` of an [OAuth client](/api-reference/ticketing/oauth/oauth_clients/#json-format) (not the client's unique identifier). For the ids, see [List Clients](/api-reference/ticketing/oauth/oauth_clients/#list-clients)
        | scopes    | array   | Valid scopes for the token. See [Scopes](#scopes) below

        #### Scopes

        The **scopes** parameter defines whether requests authenticated with the token can
        post, put, and delete data, or only get data.

        **Note**: Don't confuse the **scopes** parameter (plural) with the **scope** parameter (singular)
        for [grant-type tokens](/api-reference/ticketing/oauth/grant_type_tokens/).

        The **scopes** parameter is an array of strings, each specifying a resource name and
        an access setting. Access is either "read" or "write". If you don't specify a resource,
        access to all resources is assumed. If you don't specify the access, read and write
        access are assumed.

        The syntax is as follows:

        `"scopes": [resource:scope, ...]`

        where `resource` is optional.

        **Examples**

        `"scopes": ["read"]`

        `"scopes": ["tickets:read"]`

        To give read and write access to a resource, specify both scopes:

        `"scopes": ["users:read", "users:write"]`

        To give write access only to one resource and read access to everything
        else:

        `"scopes": ["organizations:write", "read"]`

        **Note**: The endpoint returns an access token even if you specify an
        invalid scope. Any request you make with the token will return
        a "Forbidden" error.

        **Available scopes**

        * `read` - gives access to GET endpoints. Includes
        permission to sideload related resources
        * `write` - gives access to POST, PUT, and DELETE endpoints
        * `impersonate` - allows Zendesk Support admins to make requests on behalf of
        end users. See [Making API requests on behalf of end users](/documentation/ticketing/using-the-zendesk-api/making-api-requests-on-behalf-of-end-users/)

        **Resources that can be scoped**

        * tickets
        * users
        * auditlogs (read only)
        * organizations

        * apps

        In the first endpoint, `id` is a token id, not the full token.

        In the second endpoint, include an `Authorization: Bearer` header with the full token to get its associated properties. Example:

        ```sh

          -H 'Authorization: Bearer ${authToken}' \

        #### Updating a Dropdown (Tagger) or Multiselect Field

        Dropdown and multiselect fields return an array of `custom_field_options` which specify the name, value, and order of dropdown or multiselect options. When updating a dropdown or multiselect field, note the following information:

        - All options must be passed on update. Options that are not passed will be removed. As a result, these values will be removed from any organizations
        - To create a new option, pass a null `id` along with the `name` and `value`
        - To update an existing option, pass its `id` along with the `name` and `value`
        - To reorder an option, reposition it in the `custom_field_options` array relative to the other options
        - To remove an option, omit it from the list of options upon update

        #### Example Request

        ```bash
        curl https://{subdomain}.zendesk.com/api/v2/organization_fields/{organization_field_id}.json \
          -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X PUT \

        Agents with no permissions restrictions can only update "notes" on organizations.

        **Note:** Updating an organization's `domain_names` property overwrites all existing `domain_names` values. To prevent this, submit a complete list of `domain_names` for the organization in your request.

        Returns an array of organizations matching the criteria. You may search by an organization's `external_id` or `name`, but not both:

        #### Searching by `external_id`

        If you set the `external_id` value of an organization to associate it to an external record, you can use it to search for the organization.

        For an organization to be returned, its `external_id` must exactly match the value provided (case insensitive).

        #### Searching by `name`

        For an organization to be returned, its `name` must exactly match the value provided (case insensitive).

        #### Allowed For:

        #### Batch update

        To make different changes to multiple organizations, use the following endpoint and data format:

        `https://{subdomain}.zendesk.com/api/v2/organizations/update_many.json`

        ```js
        {
          "organizations": [
            { "id": 1, "notes": "Priority" },
            { "id": 2, "notes": "Normal" }
          ]
        }
        ```

        #### Response

        This endpoint returns a `job_status` [JSON object](/api-reference/ticketing/ticket-management/job_statuses/#json-format) and queues a background job to do the work. Use the [Show Job Status](/api-reference/ticketing/ticket-management/job_statuses/#show-job-status) endpoint to check for the job's completion. Only a certain number of jobs can be queued or running at the same time. See [Job limit](/api-reference/introduction/rate-limits/#job-limit) for more information.

        #### Allowed For

        * Admins

        Adds a Zendesk or external support address to your account.

        To add a Zendesk address, use the following syntax: `{local-part}@{accountname}.zendesk.com`.
        Example: 'sales-team@example.zendesk.com'. The [local-part](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_address#Local-part) can be anything you like.

        To add an external email address such as help@omniwearshop.com, the email must already exist and you must set up forwarding on your email server. The exact steps depend on your mail server. See [Forwarding incoming email to Zendesk Support](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203663266). After setting up forwarding, run the [Verify Support Address Forwarding](#verify-support-address-forwarding) endpoint. The address won't work in Zendesk Support until it's been verified.

        Sends a test email to the specified support address to verify that email forwarding for the address works. An external support address won't work in Zendesk Support until it's verified.

        **Note**: You don't need to verify Zendesk system support addresses.

        The endpoint takes the following body: `{"type": "forwarding"}`. The value of the `type` property defaults to "forwarding" if none is specified, but the values "spf" and "dns" are also accepted.

        Use this endpoint after [adding](#create-support-address) an external support address to Zendesk Support and setting up forwarding on your email server. See [Forwarding incoming email to Zendesk Support](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203663266).

        The endpoint doesn't return the results of the test. Instead, use the [Show Support Address](#show-support-address) endpoint to check that the `forwarding_status` property is "verified".

        Other verification checks can also be performed using this API. These include SPF checks and DNS checks.

        When calling the endpoint with `type` set to "spf", it will queries the DNS records to check that the SPF records for Zendesk are present for outbound emails.

        When calling the endpoint with `type` set to "dns", it runs checks on your CNAME records to make sure they are set up properly in your DNS.

        Accepts a `request` object that sets one or more properties.

        #### Allowed for

        * End users
        * Anonymous users (rate limit of 5 requests per hour for [trial accounts](/documentation/developer-tools/getting-started/getting-a-trial-or-sponsored-account-for-development/))

        #### Additional properties

        In addition to the writable request properties in the [JSON Format table](#json-format) above, you can set the following properties when creating a request.

        | Name                | Type   | Mandatory | Comment
        | ----------------    | -------| --------- | -------
        | comment             | object | yes       | Describes the problem, incident, question, or task. See [Request comments](#request-comments)
        | collaborators       | array  | no        | Adds collaborators (cc's) to the request. An email notification is sent to them when the ticket is created. See [Setting collaborators](/documentation/ticketing/managing-tickets/creating-and-managing-requests#setting-collaborators)
        | requester           | object | yes*      | \*Required for anonymous requests. Specifies the requester of the anonymous request. See [Creating anonymous requests](/documentation/ticketing/managing-tickets/creating-and-managing-requests#creating-anonymous-requests)

        #### Creating follow-up requests

        Once a ticket is closed (as distinct from solved), it can't be reopened. However, you can create a new request that references the closed ticket. To create the follow-up request, include a `via_followup_source_id` property in the `request` object that specifies the closed ticket. The parameter only works with closed tickets. It has no effect with other tickets.

        #### Sorting

        By default, comments are sorted by creation date in ascending order.

        When using cursor pagination, use the following parameter to change the sort order:

        | Name   | Type   | Required | Comments
        | ------ | ------ | -------- | --------
        | `sort` | string | no       | Possible values are "created_at" (ascending order) or "-created_at" (descending order)

        When using offset pagination, use the following parameters to change the sort order:

        | Name         | Type   | Required | Comments
        | ------------ | ------ | -------- | --------
        | `sort_by`    | string | no       | One of `created_at`, `updated_at`

        Returns an approximate count of satisfaction ratings in the account. If the count exceeds 100,000, the count will return a cached result. This cached result will update every 24 hours.

        The `count[refreshed_at]` property is a timestamp that indicates when the count was last updated.

        **Note**: When the count exceeds 100,000, `count[refreshed_at]` may occasionally be null.
        This indicates that the count is being updated in the background, and `count[value]` is limited to 100,000 until the update is complete.

        * Offset pagination only

        Offset pagination may result in duplicate results when paging. You can also use the
        [Export Search Results](/api-reference/ticketing/ticket-management/search/#export-search-results) endpoint, which
        uses cursor-based pagination and doesn't return duplicate results. See
        [Using cursor pagination](/api-reference/introduction/pagination/#using-cursor-pagination) for more information.


        #### Errors JSON Format

        Errors are represented as JSON objects which have the following keys:

        | --------------------- | ---------------------| --------------------

      description: |
        Exports a set of results. See [Query syntax](#query-syntax) for the syntax of the `query` parameter.

        Use this endpoint for search queries that will return more than 1000 results. The result set is ordered only by the `created_at` attribute.

        The search only returns results of a single object type. The following object types are supported: ticket, organization, user, or group.

        You must specify the type in the `filter[type]` parameter. Searches with type in the query string will result in an error.

        #### Allowed For

        - Agents

        #### Pagination

        - Cursor pagination

        See [Pagination](/api-reference/introduction/pagination/).

        Returns a maximum of 1000 records per page. The number of results shown in a page is determined by the `page[size]` parameter.

        **Note**: You may experience a speed reduction or a timeout if you request 1000 results per page and you have many archived tickets in the results. Try reducing the number of results per page. We recommend 100 results per page.

        The cursor specified by the `after_cursor` property in a response expires after one hour.

        For more information on cursor-based pagination, see the following articles:

        - [Comparing cursor pagination and offset pagination](/documentation/developer-tools/pagination/comparing-cursor-pagination-and-offset-pagination)
        - [Paginating through lists using cursor pagination](/documentation/developer-tools/pagination/paginating-through-lists-using-cursor-pagination)

        #### Limits

        This API endpoint is rate-limited to 100 requests per minute per account. The limit also counts towards the global API rate limit.

        #### Response Format

        | Name                  | Type                 | Comment
        | --------------------- | ---------------------| --------------------
        | links[next]           | string               | URL to the next page of results
        | meta[has_more]        | string               | Boolean indicating if there are more results
        | meta[after_cursor]    | string               | Cursor object returned from the Search Service
        | results               | array                | May consist of tickets, users, groups, or organizations, as specified by the `filter_type` parameter

        The response is similar to the response of `GET /api/v2/search.json?`, with a few changes:

        * `links` - Has the following nested properties: `prev` and `next`. These replace the `next_page` and `prev_page` links. The `prev` property is always null because backward pagination is not supported. The `next` property may include an auto-generated link to the next page of results.
        * `meta` - Has the following nested properties: `has_more` and `after_cursor`. The `has_more` property indicates whether the next page has more results. The `after_cursor` property is the cursor used to paginate to the next page. It expires after one hour.

        There's no `count` property.

        **Note**: During recovery, the API sets the requester to the authenticated agent who called the API, not the original requester. This prevents the ticket from being re-suspended after recovery. To preserve the original requester, use the [Recover Multiple Suspended Tickets](#recover-multiple-suspended-tickets) endpoint with the single ticket.

        This endpoint does not queue an asynchronous job that can be tracked from [Job Statuses](/api-reference/ticketing/ticket-management/job_statuses/). Instead, it processes the request with a synchronous response.
           - If all recoveries are successful, it returns a 200 with a `tickets` array in the response.
           - If all recoveries fail, it returns a 422 with a `suspended_tickets` array in the response.
           - If there is a mixture of successes and failures in a single call, it returns a 422 with a `suspended_tickets` array of the failures in the response.

         Limited to one request per minute and up to one million records in return. The rate-limiting mechanism behaves identically to the one described in [Usage limits](/api-reference/ticketing/account-configuration/usage_limits/#monitoring-your-request-activity).
         We recommend using the `Retry-After` header value as described in [Catching errors caused by rate limiting](/documentation/ticketing/using-the-zendesk-api/best-practices-for-avoiding-rate-limiting#catch).

        The `refreshed_at` property of the `count` object is a timestamp that indicates when
        the count was last updated.

        **Note**: When the count exceeds 100,000, the `refreshed_at` property in the `count` object may
        occasionally be null. This indicates that the count is being
        updated in the background and the `value` property in the `count` object is limited to
        100,000 until the update is complete.

      description: |
        Returns a list of all system and custom ticket fields in your account.

        For end users, only the ticket fields with visible_in_portal set to true are returned.

        Cursor pagination returns a maximum of 100 records per page and fields are returned in the order specified by their id.

        If the results are not paginated, every field is returned in the response and fields are returned in the order specified by the position.

        You can adjust the position of ticket fields by:

        - Using the [Update Ticket Field](/api-reference/ticketing/tickets/ticket_fields/#update-ticket-field) endpoint
        - Using the [Reorder Ticket Fields](/api-reference/ticketing/tickets/ticket_fields/#reorder-ticket-fields) endpoint
        - Ticket Fields page in the Admin Center (**Admin Center** > **Manage** > **Ticket** > **Fields** > **Actions** > **Edit order**)

        These adjustments determine the order in which fields are displayed in various locations. For accounts without access to multiple ticket forms, the order will also be used to display field values within tickets. However, for accounts with access to multiple ticket forms, the field order on the ticket page is defined within each form.

        Consider caching this resource to use with the [Tickets](/api-reference/ticketing/tickets/tickets/#json-format) API.

        **Note**: Tags can't be re-used across custom ticket fields. For example, if you configure a tag for a checkbox field, you can't use that tag value for a dropdown (tagger) field option. The use of tags isn't validated and can prevent editing in the future.

        See [About custom field types](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203661866) in the Zendesk Help Center.

        #### Field limits

        We recommend the following best practices for ticket fields limits. Creating more than these amounts can affect performance.

        * 400 ticket fields per account if your account doesn't have ticket forms
        * 400 ticket fields per ticket form if your account has ticket forms

        #### Updating drop-down field options

        You can also use the update endpoint to add, update, or remove options in a drop-down custom field. Updating field options for multi-select fields works exactly the same as drop-down field options.

        **Important**: Unless you want to remove some options, you must specify all existing options in any update request. Omitting an option removes it from the drop-down field, which removes its values from any tickets or macros.

        Use the `custom_field_options` attribute to update the options. The attribute consists of an array of option objects, with each object consisting of a `name` and `value` property. The properties correspond to the "Title" and "Tag" text boxes in the admin interface. Example request body:

        ```json
        {"ticket_field": {
            "custom_field_options": [
              {"name": "Apple Pie", "value": "apple"},
              {"name": "Pecan Pie", "value": "pecan"}
            ]
          }
        }
        ```

        #### Example Request

        ```bash
        curl https://{subdomain}.zendesk.com/api/v2/ticket_fields/{id}.json \
          -d '{"ticket_field": {"custom_field_options": [{"name": "Apple Pie", "value": "apple"}, {"name": "Pecan Pie", "value": "pecan"}]}}' \
          -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X PUT \
          -v -u {email_address}/token:{api_token}
        ```

        #### Example Response

        ```http

        Returns an approximate count of system and custom ticket fields in the account. If the count exceeds 100,000, the count will return a cached result.  This cached result will update every 24 hours.

        The `count[refreshed_at]` property is a timestamp that indicates when the count was last updated.

        **Note**: When the count exceeds 100,000, `count[refreshed_at]` may occasionally be null.
        This indicates that the count is being updated in the background, and `count[value]` is limited to 100,000 until the update is complete.

        The `count[refreshed_at]` property is a timestamp that indicates when the count was last updated.

This value is cached for 24 hours, during which any requests returns the same count and timestamp. After 24 hours, the endpoint temporarily shows the same count again before providing an updated total.

        When using offset pagination, use the following parameters to change the sort order:

        | Name         | Type   | Required | Comments
        | ------------ | ------ | -------- | --------
        | `sort_order` | string | no       | One of `asc`, `desc`. Defaults to `asc`

        Redaction allows you to permanently remove attachments from an existing comment on a ticket. Once removed from a comment, the attachment is replaced with an empty "redacted.txt" file.

        The redaction is permanent. It is not possible to undo redaction or see what was removed. Once a ticket is closed, redacting its attachments is no longer possible.

        Also, if you want to redact an inline attachment, you can use the `include_inline_images` parameter in the [List Comments](/api-reference/ticketing/tickets/ticket_comments/#list-comments) operation to obtain the inline attachment ID, and use it in the request URL.

        | target_comment_is_public | boolean | no       | Whether comments in the target ticket are public or private   |
        | source_comment_is_public | boolean | no       | Whether comments in the source tickets are public or private |

        `target_comment` and `source_comment` can be used to provide a reason for the merge for recordkeeping purposes. If the source ticket has attachments, they are included in `target_comment`.

        Comments are private and can't be modified in the following cases:

          * Any of the sources or target tickets are private
          * Any of the sources or target tickets were created through X (formerly Twitter), Facebook or the Channel framework

        In any other case, comments default to private but can be modified with the comment privacy parameters.

        You can also add tags to multiple tickets with the [Update Many
        Tickets](/api-reference/ticketing/tickets/tickets/#update-many-tickets) endpoint.

        #### Safe Update

        If the same ticket is updated by multiple API requests at
        the same time, some tags could be lost because of ticket
        update collisions. Include `updated_stamp` and `safe_update`
        properties in the request body to make a safe update.

        For `updated_stamp`, retrieve and specify the ticket's
        latest `updated_at` timestamp. The tag update only occurs
        if the `updated_stamp` timestamp matches the ticket's
        actual `updated_at` timestamp at the time of the request.
        If the timestamps don't match (in other words, if the
        ticket was updated since you retrieved the ticket's
        last `updated_at` timestamp), the request returns a
        409 Conflict error.

        #### Example

        ```js
        {
          "tags": ["customer"],
          "updated_stamp":"2019-09-12T21:45:16Z",
          "safe_update":"true"
        }
        ```

        #### Pagination

        This endpoint uses cursor-based pagination. The records are ordered in
        descending order by the `created_at` timestamp, then by `id` on duplicate
        `created_at` values.

        The `cursor` parameter is a non-human-readable argument you can use to move
        forward or backward in time.

        Each JSON response will contain the following attributes to help you get
        more results:

      summary: Upload Files
      description: |
        Uploads a file that can be attached to a ticket comment. It doesn't attach the file to the comment. For details and examples, see [Attaching ticket comments with the API](/documentation/ticketing/using-the-zendesk-api/adding-ticket-attachments-with-the-api).

        The endpoint has a required `filename` query parameter. The parameter specifies what the file will be named when attached to the ticket comment (to give the agent more context about the file). The parameter does not specify the file on the local system to be uploaded. While the two names can be different, their file extensions must be the same. If they don't match, the agent's browser or file reader could give an error when attempting to open the attachment.

        The `Content-Type` header must contain a recognized MIME type that correctly describes the type of the uploaded file. Failing to send a recognized, correct type may cause undesired behavior. For example, in-browser audio playback may be interrupted by the browser's security mechanisms for MP3s uploaded with an incorrect type.

        Adding multiple files to the same upload is handled by splitting requests and passing the API token received from the first request to each subsequent request. The token is valid for 60 minutes.

        **Note**: Even if [private attachments](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204265396) are enabled in the Zendesk Support instance, uploaded files are visible to any authenticated user at the `content_URL` specified in the [JSON response](#json-format) until the upload token is consumed. Once a file is associated with a ticket or post, visibility is restricted to users with access to the ticket or post with the attachment.

        #### Updating a Dropdown (Tagger) or Multiselect Field

        Dropdown and multiselect fields return an array of `custom_field_options` which specify the name, value, and order of the list of dropdown or multiselect options.
        Understand the following behavior when updating a dropdown or multiselect field:

        - All options must be passed on update. Options that are not passed will be removed. As a result, these values will be removed from any organizations.
        - To create a new option, pass a null `id` along with `name` and `value`.
        - To update an existing option, pass its `id` along with `name` and `value`.
        - To re-order an option, reposition it in the `custom_field_options` array relative to the other options.
        - To remove an option, omit it from the list of options upon update.

        #### Example Request

        ```bash
        curl https://{subdomain}.zendesk.com/api/v2/user_fields/{user_field_id}.json \
          -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X PUT \

        | ---------------- | ------- |
        | email            | `{ "type" : "email", "value" : "someone@example.com" }` |
        | twitter          | `{ "type" : "twitter", "value" : "screen_name" }` |

        | google           | `{ "type" : "google", "value" : "example@gmail.com" }` |
        | agent_forwarding | `{ "type" : "agent_forwarding", "value" : "+1 555-123-4567" }` |
        | phone_number     | `{ "type" : "phone_number", "value" : "+1 555-123-4567" }` |

        To create an identity without sending out a verification email, include a `"skip_verify_email": true` property. The `"skip_verify_email": true` property does not apply when updating your own agent profile. A welcome or verification email will be sent regardless of this setting.

        * Unverify a verified identity (by setting `verified` to "false" or `verification_method` to "none")
        * Update the `value` property of the specified identity

        You can't change an identity's `primary` attribute with this endpoint. You must use the [Make Identity Primary](#make-identity-primary) endpoint instead.

        In certain cases, a phone number associated with an identity is still visible on the user profile after the identity has been deleted via API. You can remove the phone number from the user profile by updating the `phone` attribute of the user to an empty string. See [Update User via API](/api-reference/ticketing/users/users/#update-user) for details and examples.

        Deleting identities with type `messaging` could break messaging functionality. For example, an agent may stop being able to send messages via the messaging channel.

        **Note**: When the count exceeds 100,000, the `refreshed_at` property may occasionally be null.
        This indicates that the count is being updated in the background. The `count` object's `value` property is limited to 100,000 until the update is complete.

        #### Specifying an organization

        You can assign a user to an existing organization by setting an
        `organization_id` property in the user object.

        #### Response

        This endpoint returns a `job_status` [JSON object](/api-reference/ticketing/ticket-management/job_statuses/#json-format) and queues a background job to do the work. Use the [Show Job Status](/api-reference/ticketing/ticket-management/job_statuses/#show-job-status) endpoint to check for the job's completion. Only a certain number of jobs can be queued or running at the same time. See [Job limit](/api-reference/introduction/rate-limits/#job-limit) for more information.

      description: |
        Creates a user if the user does not already exist, or updates an existing user
        identified by e-mail address or external ID.

        If you don't specify a role parameter, the new user is assigned the role of end user.

        If you need to create users without sending out a verification email, include a `"skip_verify_email": true` property in the body.

        #### External ID Case Sensitivity

        When providing an external id to identify an existing user to update, the search for the user record is not case sensitive.

        However, if an existing user is found, the system will update the user's external id to match the case of the external id used to find the user.

        #### Response Status Code

        - If the user exists in Zendesk, a successful request returns a 200 status code with "Location: /api/v2/users/{user_id}.json".
        - If the user does not exist in Zendesk, a successful request returns a 201 status code with "Location: /api/v2/users/{new_user_id}.json".

        #### JSON Format

        The JSON format consists of one property, a `view` object that lists the values to set when the view is created.

        **Note**: The request must include at least one condition in the `all` array that checks one of the following fields: `status`, `type`, `group_id`, `assignee_id`, or `requester_id`.

        | Name        | Description
        | ----------- | -----------
        | title       | Required. The title of the view
        | all         | Required. An array of one or more conditions. A ticket must meet all of them to be included in the view. See [Conditions reference](/documentation/ticketing/reference-guides/conditions-reference)
        | any         | An array of one or more conditions. A ticket must meet any of them to be included in the view. See [Conditions reference](/documentation/ticketing/reference-guides/conditions-reference)
        | description | The description of the view
        | active      | Allowed values are true or false. Determines if the view is displayed or not
        | output      | An object that specifies the columns to display. Example: `"output": {"columns": ["status", "description", "priority"]}`. See [View columns](#view-columns)
        | restriction | An object that describes who can access the view. To give all agents access to the view, omit this property

        The `restriction` object has the following properties.

        | Name | Comment
        | ---- | -------
        | type | Allowed values are "Group" or "User"
        | id   | The numeric ID of a single group or user
        | ids  | The numeric IDs of a single or more groups. Recommended for "Group" `type`

        If `type` is "Group", the `ids` property is the preferred method of specifying the group id or ids.

        #### Example Request Body

        ```js
        {
          "view": {
            "title": "Kelly's tickets",
            "raw_title": "{{dc.tickets_assigned_to_kelly}}",
            "description": "Tickets that are assigned to Kelly",
            "active": true,
            "position": 3,
            "restriction": {
              "type": "User",
              "id": "213977756"
            },
            "all": [
              {
                "field": "status",
                "operator": "less_than",
                "value": "solved"
              },
              {

            }
          }
        }
        ```

        #### View columns

        The `output` request parameter lets you specify what columns to include in the view in the agent interface. Example: `"output": {"columns": ["status", "description", "priority"]}`. The following table lists possible columns for views in the agent UI and the corresponding values in the `columns` array.

        For custom fields, specify the id of the custom field in the `columns` array.

        You can specify a total of 10 columns to a view.

        | View column title in UI     | Value                |
        |---------------------------- | -------------------- |

        | Ticket status               | `custom_status_id`   |

        #### View sorting

        You can group and sort items in the view by adding items to the `output` parameter:

        | Attribute                   | Description
        |-----------------------------| -----------
        | `group_by`, `sort_by`       | Sort or group the tickets by a column in the [View columns](#view-columns) table. The `description`, `submitter` and `custom_status_id` columns are not supported
        | `group_order`, `sort_order` | Either "asc" or "desc"

        #### JSON Format

         The PUT request takes one property, a `view` object that lists the values to update. All properties are optional.

        **Note**: Updating a condition updates the containing array, clearing the other conditions. Include all your conditions when updating any condition.

        | Name        | Description
        | ----------- | -----------
        | title       | The title of the view
        | all         | An array of one or more conditions. A ticket must meet all the conditions to be included in the view. The PUT request replaces all existing conditions. See [Conditions reference](/documentation/ticketing/reference-guides/conditions-reference)
        | any         | An array of one or more conditions. A ticket must meet any of them to be included in the view. At least one `all` condition must be defined with the `any` conditions. The PUT request replaces all existing `any` conditions. See [Conditions reference](/documentation/ticketing/reference-guides/conditions-reference)
        | active      | Allowed values are true or false. Determines if the view is displayed or not
        | output      | An object that specifies the columns to display. Example: `"output": {"columns": ["status", "description," "priority"]}`. See [View columns](#view-columns)
        | restriction | An object that describes who can access the view. To give all agents access to the view, omit this property

        The `restriction` object has the following properties.

        | Name | Comment
        | ---- | -------
        | type | Allowed values are "Group" or "User"
        | id   | The numeric ID of a single group or user
        | ids  | The numeric IDs of a single or more groups. Recommended for "Group" `type`

        If `type` is "Group", the `ids` property is the preferred method of specifying the group id or ids.

        You can also update how items are sorted and grouped. See [View sorting](#view-sorting) in Create View.

      description: |
        Returns the ticket count for a single view.

        This endpoint is rate limited to 5 requests per minute, per view, per agent.

        #### View Counts

        The view count endpoints, Count Tickets in View (this endpoint) and [Count Tickets in Views](#count-tickets-in-views), let you estimate how many tickets remain in a view without having to retrieve the entire view. They're designed to help estimate view size. From a business perspective, accuracy becomes less relevant as view size increases.

        To ensure quality of service, these counts are cached more heavily as the number of tickets in a view grows. For a view with thousands of tickets, you can expect the count to be cached for 60-90 minutes. As a result, the count may not reflect the actual number of tickets in your view.

        View counts are represented as JSON objects with the following attributes:

        | Name            | Type        | Comment
        | --------------- | ------------| -------
        | view_id         | integer     | The id of the view
        | url             | string      | The API url of the count
        | value           | integer     | The cached number of tickets in the view. Can also be null if the system is loading and caching new data. Not to be confused with 0 tickets
        | pretty          | string      | A pretty-printed text approximation of the view count
        | fresh           | boolean     | false if the cached data is stale and the system is still loading and caching new data
        | active          | boolean     | Only active views if true, inactive views if false, all views if null.

        #### Example
        ```js
        {
          "view_count": {
            "view_id": 25,
            "url":     "https://company.zendesk.com/api/v2/views/25/count.json",

          }

        Returns the column titles and the rows of the specified view.

        The `columns` array lists the view's column titles and includes only views parameters.

        The `rows` array lists the values of each column for each ticket and includes parameters from both views and tickets. Though not displayed in the view, a partial ticket object is included with each row object.

        **Note**: To get the full ticket objects for a specified view, use [List Tickets from a View](#list-tickets-from-a-view).

        This endpoint is rate limited to 5 requests per minute, per view, per agent. This rate limit includes activity in Zendesk Support. An API script is more likely to encounter rate limit errors if the authenticating agent or admin is concurrently active in Zendesk Support.

        The view execution system is designed for periodic rather than high-frequency API usage. In particular, views called very frequently may be cached by Zendesk. This means that the API client will still receive a result, but that result may have been computed at any time within the last 10 minutes.

        Zendesk recommends using the Incremental Ticket Export endpoint to get the latest changes. You can call it more often, and it returns all the tickets that changed since the last poll. For details and rate limits, see [Incremental Exports](/api-reference/ticketing/ticket-management/incremental_exports/).

        View output sorting can be controlled by passing the `sort_by` and `sort_order` parameters in the format described in the table in [Preview Views](#preview-views).

      tags:
        - Grant Type Tokens
      summary: Create Token for Grant Type
      description: |
        Returns an OAuth access token in exchange for an [authorization code](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203663836#topic_pvr_ncl_1l) valid for 120 seconds.

        Using a Zendesk username and password to gain an OAuth access token (password grant type flow) has been deprecated and is highly discouraged.

        An access token can be revoked. Use the [OAuth Tokens API](/api-reference/ticketing/oauth/oauth_tokens) to list, show, or revoke tokens.

        The refresh token grant type allows for refreshing an access token that has either expired or is about to expire. See [Oauth Tokens for Grant Types](/api-reference/ticketing/oauth/grant_type_tokens/).

        #### Request parameters

        The POST request takes the following parameters, which must be formatted as JSON:

        | Name          | Description
        | ------------- | --------------------------------------------------
        | grant_type    | "authorization_code" or "refresh_token"
        | code          | Authorization grant flow only. The authorization code you received from Zendesk after the user granted access. See [Handle the user's authorization decision](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203663836#topic_tfc_cdl_1l) in Help Center
        | client_id     | The **Unique Identifier** specified in an OAuth client in the Support admin interface (**Admin** > **Channels** > **API** > **OAuth Clients**). See [Registering your application with Zendesk](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203663836#topic_s21_lfs_qk)
        | client_secret | The **Secret** specified in an OAuth client in the Support admin interface (**Admin** > **Channels** > **API** > **OAuth Clients**). See [Registering your application with Zendesk](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203663836#topic_s21_lfs_qk)
        | redirect_uri  | Authorization grant flow only. The redirect URL you specified when you sent the user to the Zendesk authorization page. For ID purposes only. See [Send the user to the Zendesk authorization page](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203663836#topic_qk3_d3s_qk)
        | scope         | Valid scope for this token. A string of space-separated values. See [Scope](#scope) below
        | expires_in    | Number of seconds the access token is valid. Must be more than 300 seconds (5 minutes) and less than 172,800 seconds (2 days), or less than `refresh_token_expires_in`, whichever is the smallest. Defaults to null
        | refresh_token_expires_in | Number of seconds the refresh token is valid. Must be more than 604,800 seconds (7 days) or `expires_in` (if given), and less than 7,776,000 seconds (90 days). Defaults to 2,592,000 seconds (30 days)
        | refresh_token | The refresh token

        **Example Node.js authorization code grant flow**

        ```javascript
        const tokenResponse = await axios.post(
          `https://${ZENDESK_SUBDOMAIN}.zendesk.com/oauth/tokens`,
          {
            grant_type: "authorization_code",
            code: req.query.code,
            client_id: ZENDESK_CLIENT_ID,
            redirect_uri: REDIRECT_URI_PKCE,
            scope: "read write",
            code_verifier: CODE_VERIFIER,
            expires_in: 86400,
            refresh_token_expires_in: 604800,
          },
          { headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" } }
        );
        ```

        **Example Node.js refresh token grant flow**

        ```javascript
        const tokenResponse = await axios.post(
          `https://${ZENDESK_SUBDOMAIN}.zendesk.com/oauth/tokens`,
          {
            grant_type: "refresh_token",
            refresh_token: refresh_token,
            client_id: ZENDESK_CLIENT_ID,
            client_secret: ZENDESK_CLIENT_SECRET,
            scopes: "tickets:write",
            expires_in: 86400,
            refresh_token_expires_in: 604800,
          },
          { headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" } }
        );
        ```

        #### Scope

        You must specify a scope to control the app's access to Zendesk resources. The "read" scope gives access to GET endpoints. It includes permission to sideload related resources. The "write" scope gives access to POST, PUT, and DELETE endpoints for creating, updating, and deleting resources.

        **Note**: Don't confuse the **scope** parameter (singular) with the **scopes** parameter (plural) for non-grant-type tokens described in [OAuth Tokens](/api-reference/ticketing/oauth/oauth_tokens).

        The "impersonate" scope allows a Zendesk admin to make requests on behalf of end users. See [Making API requests on behalf of end users](/documentation/ticketing/using-the-zendesk-api/making-api-requests-on-behalf-of-end-users/).

        For example, the following parameter gives read access to all resources:

        `"scope": "read"`

        The following parameter gives read and write access to all resources:

        `"scope": "read write"`

        You can fine-tune the scope of the following resources:

        - tickets
        - users
        - auditlogs (read only)
        - organizations
        - hc
        - apps
        - triggers
        - automations
        - targets
        - webhooks

        The syntax is as follows:

        `"scope": "resource:scope"`

        For example, the following parameter restricts the scope to only reading tickets:

        `"scope": "tickets:read"`

        To give read and write access to a resource, specify both scopes:

        `"scope": "users:read users:write"`

        To give write access only to one resource, such as organizations, and read access to everything else:

        `"scope": "organizations:write read"`

        **Note**: The endpoint returns an access token even if you specify an invalid scope such as `"scope": ["read", "write"]` (no parentheses). Any request you make with the token will return a "Forbidden" error.

        #### Tokens for Implicit Grant Type

        The implicit grant flow has been deprecated. It's considered insecure and its use is highly discouraged.
