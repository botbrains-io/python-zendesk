================================================
This is the reference documentation for the Zendesk Support API, which is also known as the Ticketing API. You can use the Support API with tickets, users, organizations, [custom objects](/api-reference/custom-data/introduction/)
, and manage ticket workflows.

Any general mechanisms and conventions, such as pagination and authentication, work as described in the [Zendesk API introduction](/api-reference/introduction/introduction/)
and are considered implied in this text.

In addition to the reference docs, the following resources are available:

- [Zendesk API quick start](/documentation/ticketing/getting-started/zendesk-api-quick-start/)
- [Zendesk Ticketing API articles and tutorials](/documentation/ticketing/)
- [Zendesk APIs community](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/community/topics/1260801854210)

### Run in Postman

For information on the HTTP status codes returned by the API, see [Response format](/api-reference/introduction/requests/#response-format)
in the general API introduction.

### [](#idempotency) Idempotency

The Ticketing API lets you specify an [idempotency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence)
key that allows you to retry a ticket creation request without the risk of creating duplicate records.

To specify an idempotency key, provide a `Idempotency-Key: {unique_key}` header with your request.

Example:

This creates the following response, which also includes a `x-idempotency-lookup: miss` header:

If you repeat the same request using the same body and idempotency key, another ticket is not created. Instead, you'll get the same response as before that is cached under the idempotency key. This time the response includes a `x-idempotency-lookup: hit` header:

If you create a request using the same idempotency key but with a different body, you'll receive the following error:

Keys expire after two hours. If a request with a duplicate key is sent two hours after the original request, the request will create a new ticket.

The idempotency key is not stored as part of the ticket response. You will not be able to see the key when the ticket is opened.

### [](#data-types) Data types

For information on data types used in the API, see [Data types](/api-reference/introduction/data-types/)

# https://developer.zendesk.com/api-reference/ticketing/tickets/ticket-attachments/ - Attachments | Zendesk Developer Docszendev_horizontalzendev_horizontal with metadata date undefined

================================================
You can upload a file and attach it to a ticket comment. The attachment appears as a link in the ticket comment in the agent interface in Zendesk. If ticket notifications are enabled, the attachment appears as a link in the notification email.

Use the Attachments API to upload a file you want to attach. However, you can only attach the uploaded file to a ticket comment with the [Tickets API](/api-reference/ticketing/tickets/tickets/)
when adding the comment to a ticket you're creating or updating.

For details and examples, see [Adding ticket attachments with the API](/documentation/ticketing/using-the-zendesk-api/adding-ticket-attachments-with-the-api)
.

This API is for tickets attachments. To attach files to articles in your help center, see [Article Attachments](/api-reference/help_center/help-center-api/article_attachments/)
in the Help Center API documentation.

### [](#json-format) JSON format

Attachments are represented as JSON objects with the following properties:

A file represented as an [Attachment](/api-reference/ticketing/tickets/ticket-attachments/)
object

#### [](#example) Example

### [](#upload-files) Upload Files

- `POST /api/v2/uploads`

Uploads a file that can be attached to a ticket comment. It doesn't attach the file to the comment. For details and examples, see [Attaching ticket comments with the API](/documentation/ticketing/using-the-zendesk-api/adding-ticket-attachments-with-the-api)
.

The endpoint has a required `filename` query parameter. The parameter specifies what the file will be named when attached to the ticket comment (to give the agent more context about the file). The parameter does not specify the file on the local system to be uploaded. While the two names can be different, their file extensions must be the same. If they don't match, the agent's browser or file reader could give an error when attempting to open the attachment.

The `Content-Type` header must contain a recognized MIME type that correctly describes the type of the uploaded file. Failing to send a recognized, correct type may cause undesired behavior. For example, in-browser audio playback may be interrupted by the browser's security mechanisms for MP3s uploaded with an incorrect type.

Adding multiple files to the same upload is handled by splitting requests and passing the API token received from the first request to each subsequent request. The token is valid for 60 minutes.

**Note**: Even if [private attachments](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204265396)
are enabled in the Zendesk Support instance, uploaded files are visible to any authenticated user at the `content_URL` specified in the [JSON response](#json-format)
until the upload token is consumed. Once a file is associated with a ticket or post, visibility is restricted to users with access to the ticket or post with the attachment.

### [](#redact-comment-attachment) Redact Comment Attachment

- `PUT /api/v2/tickets/{ticket_id}/comments/{comment_id}/attachments/{attachment_id}/redact`

Redaction allows you to permanently remove attachments from an existing comment on a ticket. Once removed from a comment, the attachment is replaced with an empty "redacted.txt" file.

The redaction is permanent. It is not possible to undo redaction or see what was removed. Once a ticket is closed, redacting its attachments is no longer possible.

Also, if you want to redact an inline attachment, you can use the `include_inline_images` parameter in the [List Comments](/api-reference/ticketing/tickets/ticket_comments/#list-comments)
operation to obtain the inline attachment ID, and use it in the request URL.

#### [](#allowed-for-4) Allowed For

# https://developer.zendesk.com/api-reference/ticketing/tickets/ticket_metric_events/ - Ticket Metric Events | Zendesk Developer Docszendev_horizontalzendev_horizontal with metadata date undefined

================================================
You can use the ticket metric events API to track reply times, agent work times, and requester wait times.

For example, if you want to measure reply times, you can get the time a ticket was created and the time an agent first replied to it. If you want to measure requester wait times, you can get the time the ticket was created and the time its status was changed to solved.

The times are reported as _metric events_, or events that are related to each of the three metrics: reply time, agent work time, and requester wait time. You can access the following six types of metric events, with different events for each type depending on the metric:

- **activate events**, such as when a ticket is created in the case of all three metrics
- **fulfill events**, such as when an agent first replies to a ticket in the case of the reply time metric, or when a ticket is solved in the case of the requester wait time metric
- **pause events**, such as when a ticket status is changed to pending or on-hold in the case of the agent work time metric
- **apply_sla events**, such as when a SLA policy is applied to a ticket or when an SLA policy or target is changed on a ticket
- **apply_group_sla events**, such as when a Group SLA policy is applied to a ticket or when an Group SLA policy or target is changed on a ticket
- **breach events**, such as when a SLA target is breached
- **update_status events**, such as when a metric is fulfilled

Allowed values are "activate", "pause", "fulfill", "apply_sla", "apply_group_sla", "breach", "update_status", or "measure". |

In addition to the general properties above, additional properties may be available depending on the event `type`:

| Name      | Type   | Read-only | Mandatory | Comment                                                                                                                                                            |
| --------- | ------ | --------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| sla       | object | yes       | no        | Available if `type` is "apply_sla". The SLA policy and target being enforced on the ticket and metric in question, if any. See [sla](#sla)                         |
| group_sla | object | yes       | no        | Available if `type` is "apply_group_sla". The Group SLA policy and target being enforced on the ticket and metric in question, if any. See [group_sla](#group_sla) |
| status    | object | yes       | no        | Available if `type` is "update_status". Minutes since the metric has been open. See [status](#status)                                                              |

#### [](#instance_id) instance_id

Use the `instance_id` property to track each instance of a metric event that can occur more than once per ticket, such as the `reply_time` event. The value increments over the lifetime of the ticket.

#### [](#sla) sla

The optional `sla` property provides key information about the SLA policy and target being enforced on the ticket and metric in question. The target time is provided in minutes, along with whether the target is being measured in business or calendar hours. Policy information is also provided, including the ID, title, and description of the policy currently applied to the ticket.

#### [](#group_sla) group_sla

The optional `group_sla` property provides key information about the Group SLA policy and target being enforced on the ticket and metric in question. The target time is provided in minutes, along with whether the target is being measured in business or calendar hours. Policy information is also provided, including the id, title, and description of the policy currently applied to the ticket.

#### [](#status) status

The optional `status` property provides the number of minutes in both business and calendar hours for which the metric has been open. The `status` property is only updated for a `fulfill` event. Any ticket metric that hasn't breached yet or fulfilled at least once won't have a calculated status.

#### [](#deleted) deleted

The `deleted` property is used to indicate whether or not an event should be ignored. In general, you can ignore any event where `deleted` is true.

#### [](#example) Example

### [](#list-ticket-metric-events) List Ticket Metric Events

- `GET /api/v2/incremental/ticket_metric_events?start_time={start_time}`

Returns ticket metric events that occurred on or after the start time.

Cursor pagination returns a maximum of 100 records per page. Events are listed in chronological order.

If the results are not paginated, events will be returned as a time-based incremental export.

See [Time-based incremental exports](/documentation/ticketing/managing-tickets/using-the-incremental-export-api#time-based-incremental-exports)

# https://developer.zendesk.com/api-reference/ticketing/tickets/ticket_import/ - Ticket Import | Zendesk Developer Docszendev_horizontalzendev_horizontal with metadata date undefined

================================================
You can use the imports API to move tickets in bulk from legacy systems into Zendesk Support.

Ticket imports support the normal ticket properties outlined in [Tickets](/api-reference/ticketing/tickets/tickets/#json-format)
, but have some additional features and restrictions.

##### [](#timestamps) Timestamps

You can set the following time stamps on the tickets: `solved_at`, `updated_at`, and `created_at`. However, providing a value for `created_at` or `updated_at` before 1970 will be automatically rounded up to 1970.

##### [](#comments) Comments

You can include one or more comments with a ticket. See [Ticket Comments](/api-reference/ticketing/tickets/ticket_comments/#json-format)
for the properties. You can use `value`, `body`, or `html_body` for the comment body. You can also set the comment's `created_at` time stamp. However, you can't set the time stamp before 1970 or in the future.

##### [](#direct-to-archive) Direct to archive

Ticket imports support the additional request parameter of `archive_immediately`. If true, any ticket created with a `closed` status bypasses the normal ticket lifecycle and will be created directly in your ticket archive. It's important to note that archived tickets have a handful of restrictions around their use. [You can read more about it here](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203657756-About-ticket-archiving)
.

You may want to explore this option if you are importing a large amount of historical data (750,000+ tickets) and don't want to impact the performance of your active tickets.

##### [](#attachments) Attachments

Attachments are handled the same way as in the tickets API. You upload the files then supply the token in the comment parameters. See [Attaching files](/api-reference/ticketing/tickets/tickets/#attaching-files)
.

##### [](#triggers) Triggers

If a ticket with a status other than closed is imported, triggers won't run on the imported ticket. However, if the ticket is updated after import, triggers will resume.

##### [](#metrics) Metrics

Zendesk metrics and SLAs are not supported for imported tickets. Running metrics or SLAs on imported tickets will result in incomplete and inaccurate data. Zendesk recommends adding a tag to signify these tickets were imported into Zendesk Support and excluding them from any reports.

##### [](#notifications) Notifications

No notifications are sent to users cc'ed on the imported tickets. Notifications are sent on subsequent updates to the tickets.

### [](#ticket-import) Ticket Import

- `POST /api/v2/imports/tickets`

#### [](#allowed-for) Allowed For

- Admins

#### [](#parameters) Parameters

| Name                | Type    | In    | Required | Description                                                                                                                                   |

# https://developer.zendesk.com/api-reference/ticketing/tickets/ticket_audits/ - Ticket Audits | Zendesk Developer Docszendev_horizontalzendev_horizontal with metadata date undefined

================================================
Audits are a read-only history of all updates to a ticket. When a ticket is updated in Zendesk Support, an audit is stored. Each audit represents a single update to the ticket. An update can consist of one or more events. Examples:

- The value of a ticket field was changed
- A new comment was added
- Tags were added or removed
- A notification was sent

For a complete list, see the [Ticket Audit events reference](/documentation/ticketing/reference-guides/ticket-audit-events-reference)
.

### [](#required-oauth-scope) Required OAuth scope

The Ticket Audits endpoints require a global "read" scope for OAuth authentication. You can't access the endpoints using the "auditlogs:read" or "tickets:read" scopes.

### [](#json-format) JSON format

Ticket Audits are represented as JSON objects with the following properties:

#### [](#example) Example

### [](#list-all-ticket-audits) List All Ticket Audits

- `GET /api/v2/ticket_audits`

Returns ticket audits. Archived tickets are not included in the response. Use the [List Audits for a Ticket](#list-audits-for-a-ticket)
endpoint to retrieve audit records for an archived ticket. To learn more about archived tickets, see [About archived tickets](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203657756)
.

This endpoint should not be used for capturing change data. When continually chasing the tail of a cursor, some records will be skipped. For this use case, use the [Incremental Ticket Event Export API](/api-reference/ticketing/ticket-management/incremental_exports/#incremental-ticket-event-export)
.

Returns an approximate count of audits for a specified ticket. If the count exceeds 100,000, the count will return a cached result. This cached result will update every 24 hours.

The `count[refreshed_at]` property is a timestamp that indicates when the count was last updated.

**Note**: If the total number of audits for a ticket exceeds 100,000, this endpoint returns a count of 100,000 with a `count[refreshed_at]` value of null. This value is cached for 24 hours, during which any requests returns the same count and timestamp. After 24 hours, the endpoint temporarily shows the same count again before providing an updated total.

# https://developer.zendesk.com/api-reference/ticketing/tickets/ticket-requests/ - Requests | Zendesk Developer Docszendev_horizontalzendev_horizontal with metadata date undefined

================================================
A _request_ is an end user's perspective on a ticket. End users can only see public comments and certain fields of a ticket. Use this API to let end users view, update, and create tickets they have access to.

You can sideload some resources with requests. See Requests in [Supported Endpoints](/documentation/ticketing/using-the-zendesk-api/side_loading/#supported-endpoints)
in Side-loading.

#### [](#authentication) Authentication

End users can use the Requests API.

**Note**: An end user won't be able to view their requests if the end user added an email identity (an email address associated with a Zendesk profile) after September 17, 2017, and didn't verify the email address. The problem is flagged by the API with a 403 response. See [Verifying a user's email address](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203663786)
in the Support Help Center.

Anonymous requests are supported for ticket creation but can be disabled by administrators. These anonymous requests have a rate limit of 5 requests per hour for [trial accounts](/documentation/developer-tools/getting-started/getting-a-trial-or-sponsored-account-for-development/)
. See [Create Request](#create-request)
below.

Admins and agents are treated as end users when using the Requests endpoint.

#### [](#multibrand-accounts) Multibrand accounts

On the Enterprise plan and above, a Support account can have more than one brand. See [Understanding how Multibrand works in your account](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204108983#topic_hyq_l1v_cr)
in the Support Help Center.

If you have multiple brands in your account, the Requests API only returns tickets for the brand specified in the API path. It doesn't return all tickets in the account. In the API path, the brand is specified by the subdomain. For example, a GET request to `https://omniwear.zendesk.com/api/v2/requests.json` only returns tickets for the Omniwear brand, even if Omniwear is the default brand.

#### [](#status-legacy-and-custom-ticket-status) Status (legacy) and Custom Ticket Status

See [Status (legacy) and Custom Ticket Status in Tickets](</api-reference/ticketing/tickets/tickets/#status-(legacy)-and-Custom-Ticket-Status>)

================================================
The Ticket Activities API returns ticket activities by other people affecting the agent making the API request. Ticket activities include assigning a ticket to the agent, increasing the priority of a ticket assigned to the agent, or adding a comment to a ticket assigned to the agent. A possible use case for the API is building a personalized notification service for agents.

#### [](#example) Example

### [](#list-activities) List Activities

- `GET /api/v2/activities`

Lists ticket activities in the last 30 days affecting the agent making the request. Also sideloads the following arrays of user records:

- actors - All actors involved in the listed activities
- users - All users involved in the listed activities

#### [](#pagination) Pagination

- Cursor pagination (recommended)
- Offset pagination

See [Pagination](/api-reference/introduction/pagination/)
.

Returns a maximum of 100 records per page.

### [](#count-activities) Count Activities

- `GET /api/v2/activities/count`
- `GET /api/v2/activities/count`

Returns an approximate count of ticket activities in the last 30 days affecting the agent making the request. If the count exceeds 100,000, the count will return a cached result. This cached result will update every 24 hours.

The `count[refreshed_at]` property is a timestamp that indicates when the count was last updated.

**Note**: When the count exceeds 100,000, `count[refreshed_at]` may occasionally be null. This indicates that the count is being updated in the background, and `count[value]` is limited to 100,000 until the update is complete.

================================================
Ticket comments represent the conversation between requesters, collaborators, and agents. Comments can be public or private.

For information on comments in requests as opposed to tickets, see [Request comments](/api-reference/ticketing/tickets/ticket-requests/#request-comments)
.

#### [](#creating-ticket-comments) Creating ticket comments

Ticket comments, including voice comments, are created with the [Tickets API](/api-reference/ticketing/tickets/tickets/)
, not the Ticket Comments API described in this document. The Tickets Comments API has no endpoint to create comments.

Ticket comments are created by including a `comment` object in the `ticket` object when creating or updating the ticket. Example:

To learn more, see [Adding voice comments to tickets](/documentation/ticketing/managing-tickets/adding-voice-comments-to-tickets)
.

**Note**: A ticket can contain up to 5000 comments in total, including both public and private comments. Once this limit is reached, any additional attempts to add comments results in a 422 error. The ticket can still be updated in other ways, provided that no new comments are added.

See also the following reference documentation:

- [Create Ticket](/api-reference/ticketing/tickets/tickets/#create-ticket)
- [Update Ticket](/api-reference/ticketing/tickets/tickets/#update-ticket)

### [](#json-format) JSON format

Ticket Comments are represented as JSON objects with the following properties:

| Name        | Type    | Read-only | Mandatory | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

#### [](#author-id) Author id

If you set the `author_id`, the user with the id is shown as the author of the comment. However, this user is not considered the updater of the ticket. The authenticated user making the API request is the updater. This has implications for business rules and views, such as the requester updated attribute and current user conditions.

#### [](#bodies) Bodies

To submit a ticket comment, use only `body` or `html_body` in your inbound API call. `plain_body` is not supported. If you pass a `plain_body` parameter in an API to create a comment, it is stripped out.

If you use `body`, multiple consecutive spaces are collapsed into a single space and multiple consecutive newline ("\n") characters are collapsed into a single newline. To preserve your spacing, use alternating space and non-breaking space characters (you must use the Unicode `\u00a0` and not ). To preserve your line breaks, enter an extra space after "\n". For example, to generate three empty lines, use "\n \n \n".

If you use `html_body` (recommended for Agent Workspace), you can use standard HTML syntax for comment formatting, including for line breaks.

The comment body is presented as `plain_body`, `body`, or `html_body`. `html_body` is the least sanitized option; `plain_body` is the most sanitized. Text input in `body` defaults to `plain_body` if there's an error in sanitizing.

For example, if you include HTML in the `body`, the HTML will be stripped out. Use `html_body` instead of `body` to include HTML. Example:

Markdown formatting is supported in `body` but not in `html_body`. Markdown formatting in `body` renders only if the comment author is an agent. To format end user comments, use `html_body` and HTML. Example:

You can include [ticket placeholders](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408886858138)
in the `body` or `html_body`. Example:

When the request is processed, the placeholder is replaced by a value if one is available. If the placeholder is not supported (example, `{{fake}}`), the placeholder is stripped out.

**Note**: If you want to display double curly brackets in the comment, use `html_body` with HTML code tags (). You can also escape placeholders in `body` with double backslashes (`\\{{fake}}`). Though the placeholder won't appear in the response, it will appear in the ticket in Agent Workspace.

#### [](#body-size-limits) Body size limits

Ticket comment bodies are limited to 64kB. Any characters exceeding this limit are truncated. No error is reported.

#### [](#comment-flags) Comment flags

Each comment can be flagged by Zendesk for several reasons. If the comment is flagged, the `metadata` property will have a `flags` array with any of the following values:

| Value | Reason for flag                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

**Example**

#### [](#example) Example

### [](#list-comments) List Comments

- `GET /api/v2/tickets/{ticket_id}/comments`

Returns the comments added to the ticket.

Each comment may include a `content_url` for an attachment or a `recording_url` for a voice comment that points to a file that may be hosted externally. For security reasons, take care not to inadvertently send Zendesk authentication credentials to third parties when attempting to access these files. See [Working with url properties](/documentation/ticketing/managing-tickets/working-with-url-properties)
.

#### [](#pagination) Pagination

- Cursor pagination (recommended)
- Offset pagination

See [Pagination](/api-reference/introduction/pagination/)
.

Returns a maximum of 100 records per page.

#### [](#sorting) Sorting

By default, comments are sorted by creation date in ascending order.

When using cursor pagination, use the following parameter to change the sort order:

| Name   | Type   | Required | Comments                                                                               |
| ------ | ------ | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `sort` | string | no       | Possible values are "created_at" (ascending order) or "-created_at" (descending order) |

When using offset pagination, use the following parameters to change the sort order:

| Name         | Type   | Required | Comments                                |
| ------------ | ------ | -------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `sort_order` | string | no       | One of `asc`, `desc`. Defaults to `asc` |

### [](#count-ticket-comments) Count Ticket Comments

- `GET /api/v2/tickets/{ticket_id}/comments/count`
- `GET /api/v2/tickets/{ticket_id}/comments/count`

Returns an approximate count of the comments added to the ticket. If the count exceeds 100,000, the count will return a cached result. This cached result will update every 24 hours.

The `count[refreshed_at]` property is a timestamp that indicates when the count was last updated.

**Note**: When the count exceeds 100,000, `count[refreshed_at]` may occasionally be null. This indicates that the count is being updated in the background, and `count[value]` is limited to 100,000 until the update is complete.

### [](#redact-ticket-comment-in-agent-workspace) Redact Ticket Comment In Agent Workspace

- `PUT /api/v2/comment_redactions/{ticket_comment_id}`

Redaction allows you to permanently remove words, strings, or attachments from a ticket comment.

In the `html_body` of the comment, wrap the content you want redacted in tags. Example:

The characters in the redact tag will be replaced by the ▇ symbol.

To redact HTML elements such inline images, anchor tags, and links, add the `redact` tag attribute to the element as well as the tag to inner text, if any. Example:

The `redact` attribute only redacts the tag. Any inner text will be left behind if not enclosed in a tag.

Redaction is permanent and can not be undone. Data is permanently deleted from Zendesk servers with no way to recover it.

This endpoint provides all the same functionality that the [Redact String in Comment](/api-reference/ticketing/tickets/ticket_comments/#redact-string-in-comment)
endpoint provides, plus:

- Redaction of comments in closed tickets
- Redaction of comments in archived tickets
- Redaction of formatted text (bold, italics, hyperlinks)

**Limitations**: When content is redacted from an email comment, the content is also redacted from the original email through a background job. It may take a while for the changes to be completed.

**Note**: We recommend using this endpoint instead of the [Redact String in Comment](/api-reference/ticketing/tickets/ticket_comments/#redact-string-in-comment)
endpoint, which will eventually be deprecated.

================================================
Use the Email Notifications API to find out what happened after an email was sent to its recipients. For example, you can use the API to determine if an outbound email was actually delivered and, if not, understand why based on the delivery status codes returned by the email service providers upon request; For more information about email notifications, see [Understanding email delivery failures in the Zendesk Agent Workspace](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/7917145637530)
in Zendesk help.

### [](#delivery-status-reference) Delivery Status Reference

Every recipient from an email notification includes a delivery status information, with "id", "name", "code", and "message" properties. This provides more information directly from the email service providers during the email delivery transaction.

The following table contains for possible values for delivery status:

| Id  | Name                                      | SMTP Status Code | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

#### [](#example) Example

### [](#list-ticket-fields) List Ticket Fields

- `GET /api/v2/ticket_fields`

Returns a list of all system and custom ticket fields in your account.

For end users, only the ticket fields with visible_in_portal set to true are returned.

Cursor pagination returns a maximum of 100 records per page and fields are returned in the order specified by their id.

If the results are not paginated, every field is returned in the response and fields are returned in the order specified by the position.

You can adjust the position of ticket fields by:

- Using the [Update Ticket Field](/api-reference/ticketing/tickets/ticket_fields/#update-ticket-field)
  endpoint
- Using the [Reorder Ticket Fields](/api-reference/ticketing/tickets/ticket_fields/#reorder-ticket-fields)
  endpoint
- Ticket Fields page in the Admin Center (**Admin Center** > **Manage** > **Ticket** > **Fields** > **Actions** > **Edit order**)

These adjustments determine the order in which fields are displayed in various locations. For accounts without access to multiple ticket forms, the order will also be used to display field values within tickets. However, for accounts with access to multiple ticket forms, the field order on the ticket page is defined within each form.

Consider caching this resource to use with the [Tickets](/api-reference/ticketing/tickets/tickets/#json-format)
API.

Returns an approximate count of system and custom ticket fields in the account. If the count exceeds 100,000, the count will return a cached result. This cached result will update every 24 hours.

The `count[refreshed_at]` property is a timestamp that indicates when the count was last updated.

**Note**: When the count exceeds 100,000, `count[refreshed_at]` may occasionally be null. This indicates that the count is being updated in the background, and `count[value]` is limited to 100,000 until the update is complete.

| tagger            | Single-select dropdown menu. It contains one or more tag values belonging to the field's options. Example: ( {"id": 21938362, "value": ["hd_3000", "hd_5555"]})                               |
| lookup            | A field to create a relationship (see [lookup relationships](/api-reference/ticketing/lookup_relationships/lookup_relationships/) ) to another object such as a user, ticket, or organization |

**Note**: Tags can't be re-used across custom ticket fields. For example, if you configure a tag for a checkbox field, you can't use that tag value for a dropdown (tagger) field option. The use of tags isn't validated and can prevent editing in the future.

See [About custom field types](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203661866)
in the Zendesk Help Center.

We recommend the following best practices for ticket fields limits. Creating more than these amounts can affect performance.

- 400 ticket fields per account if your account doesn't have ticket forms
- 400 ticket fields per ticket form if your account has ticket forms

#### [](#updating-drop-down-field-options) Updating drop-down field options

You can also use the update endpoint to add, update, or remove options in a drop-down custom field. Updating field options for multi-select fields works exactly the same as drop-down field options.

**Important**: Unless you want to remove some options, you must specify all existing options in any update request. Omitting an option removes it from the drop-down field, which removes its values from any tickets or macros.

Use the `custom_field_options` attribute to update the options. The attribute consists of an array of option objects, with each object consisting of a `name` and `value` property. The properties correspond to the "Title" and "Tag" text boxes in the admin interface. Example request body:

#### [](#limits-1) Limits

This endpoint has its own rate limit that is different from the account wide rate limit. When calls are made to this endpoint, this limit will be consumed and you will get a `429 Too Many Requests` response code if the allocation is exhausted.

##### [](#headers-1) Headers

API responses include usage limit information in the headers for this endpoint.

Within this header, “Total” signifies the initial allocation, “Remaining” indicates the remaining allowance for the current interval, and “Resets” denotes the wait time in seconds before the limit refreshes. You can see the Total, and Interval values in the below table.

##### [](#details-1) Details

This is the limit definition for the update action.

| Rate Limits                 | Scopes  | Interval | Sandbox | Trial | Default |

# https://developer.zendesk.com/api-reference/ticketing/tickets/conversation_log/ - Conversation Log | Zendesk Developer Docszendev_horizontalzendev_horizontal with metadata date undefined

================================================
The Conversation Log API provides a read-only list of all ticket and conversational events appended to a ticket.

**Conversational events** include messages sent by agents, end users, or bots.

**Ticket events** cover interactions such as adding new comments to the ticket.

For a complete list of events, see the [Conversation Log events reference](/documentation/ticketing/reference-guides/conversation-log-events-reference)
.

### [](#eap-scope) EAP Scope

The Conversation Log API is currently part of an early release program. The coverage of events is currently limited but it would increase in future API releases.

### [](#json-format) JSON format

# https://developer.zendesk.com/api-reference/ticketing/tickets/sharing_agreements/ - Sharing Agreements | Zendesk Developer Docszendev_horizontalzendev_horizontal with metadata date undefined

================================================
Tickets can be shared between Zendesk accounts. To enable ticket sharing, a sharing agreement must be sent by one account and accepted by the other account. Sharing agreements work as follows:

- Any Zendesk account can invite another account to establish a sharing agreement.
- The initiating account (the sender) sets the terms of the sharing agreement, which the receiving account can accept or not.
- Sharing agreements are one way. Once the receiver accepts the agreement, the sender may share tickets with the receiver. If the receiver wants to share tickets with the sender, they must create and send a sharing agreement to the other account.

To learn more, see [Sharing tickets with other Zendesk accounts](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203661466)
in Zendesk help.

# https://developer.zendesk.com/api-reference/ticketing/tickets/custom_ticket_statuses/ - Custom Ticket Statuses | Zendesk Developer Docszendev_horizontalzendev_horizontal with metadata date undefined

================================================
Zendesk has a default set of system ticket statuses that help you manage ticket workflows. If your account has activated custom ticket statuses, you can create additional, more-specific ticket statuses.

For more information about custom ticket statuses, see [Activating custom ticket statuses](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4412575841306)
in Zendesk help.

### [](#status-categories) Status categories

Each custom ticket status belongs to a status category. Each category corresponds to one of the built-in system ticket statuses:

- "new"
- "open"
- "pending"
- "hold"
- "solved"

**Note:** Tickets with a "Closed" status belong to the "solved" status category.

You can't create, change, or delete status categories.

#### [](#changing-the-default-ticket-status-of-a-status-category) Changing the default ticket status of a status category

Each status category has a default ticket status that's always active. When using the API, you can only change a category's default ticket status using a [Bulk Update Default Custom Ticket Status](#bulk-update-default-custom-ticket-status)
request.

**Note:** The "hold" status category and its corresponding system ticket status are optional. If it's inactive, the "hold" status category doesn't require an active default ticket status.

### [](#limitations) Limitations

Custom ticket statuses have the following limitations:

- 300 custom ticket statuses per account
- 100 custom ticket statuses per status category

### [](#json-format) JSON format

Custom Ticket Statuses are represented as JSON objects with the following properties:

# https://developer.zendesk.com/api-reference/ticketing/tickets/suspended_tickets/ - Suspended Tickets | Zendesk Developer Docszendev_horizontalzendev_horizontal with metadata date undefined

================================================
In most cases, when an end user submits a support request by email, the email becomes a new ticket or adds a comment to an existing ticket. However, in certain cases, the email becomes a suspended ticket. It remains suspended until someone reviews the email and decides whether to accept or reject it. If no one reviews it, the email is deleted after 14 days.

You can use this API to list, recover, or delete suspended tickets. For more information about suspended tickets, see [Understanding and managing suspended tickets and spam](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408889141146)

### [](#recover-suspended-ticket) Recover Suspended Ticket

- `PUT /api/v2/suspended_tickets/{id}/recover`

**Note**: During recovery, the API sets the requester to the authenticated agent who called the API, not the original requester. This prevents the ticket from being re-suspended after recovery. To preserve the original requester, use the [Recover Multiple Suspended Tickets](#recover-multiple-suspended-tickets)
endpoint with the single ticket.

This endpoint does not queue an asynchronous job that can be tracked from [Job Statuses](/api-reference/ticketing/ticket-management/job_statuses/)
. Instead, it processes the request with a synchronous response.

- If all recoveries are successful, it returns a 200 with a `tickets` array in the response.
- If all recoveries fail, it returns a 422 with a `suspended_tickets` array in the response.
- If there is a mixture of successes and failures in a single call, it returns a 422 with a `suspended_tickets` array of the failures in the response.

# https://developer.zendesk.com/api-reference/ticketing/tickets/ticket_forms/ - Ticket Forms | Zendesk Developer Docszendev_horizontalzendev_horizontal with metadata date undefined

================================================
Ticket forms allow an admin to define a subset of ticket fields for display to both agents and end users. Accounts are limited to 300 ticket forms.

Ticket forms are supported on Suite Growth plans and above, as well as on Support Enterprise plans.

For legacy accounts, ticket forms are only available on Enterprise accounts or accounts with the [Productivity Pack add-on](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408889260186)
.

### [](#json-format) JSON format

When a user has multiple email addresses, Zendesk will choose the best one to deliver email notifications. The `deliverable_state` property helps to determine that identity. If the value is "deliverable", Zendesk will likely use that identity over other email addresses; in the same way, Zendesk will not choose an email address that will likely fail to receive an email.

| Value                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| deliverable            | Email address marked as deliverable                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| undeliverable          | Email address marked as undeliverable                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| mandatory              | Email address marked as mandatory. Zendesk will prefer this address in some situations when the user switches identities                                                                                                                                      |

#### [](#verification-method) Verification method

Email verification settles a trusted connection of ownership between a specific Zendesk user and an email identity. The `verification` property indicates whether or not a full email verification has taken place.

The `verification_method` property can have any of the following values:

| Value | Description                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ----- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| none  | The user has provided an email address                                                                                                                                                 |
| low   | An individual agent has marked the email as verified                                                                                                                                   |
| sso   | The identity provider has included the email as a SAML assertion or claim, as part of SSO login flow                                                                                   |
| embed | The email was provided in a JWT as part of an embedded Web Widget or SDK login flow. See [Setting up user authentication](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4411666638746) |
| full  | Zendesk has run an email verification flow first hand                                                                                                                                  |

The API only allows the `verification_method` property to be directly set to the values "none" or "low". For example, the only way to get the value to "full" would be to have the end user complete an email verification flow. An attempt to set "sso", "embed" or "full" `verification_method` states directly is rejected with a 400 Bad Request error.

#### [](#example) Example

- `POST /api/v2/users/{user_id}/identities`
- `POST /api/v2/end_users/{user_id}/identities.json`

Adds an identity to a user's profile. An agent can add an identity to any user profile.

Supported identity types:

| Type             | Example                                                        |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |

### [](#update-identity) Update Identity

- `PUT /api/v2/users/{user_id}/identities/{user_identity_id}`

This endpoint allows you to:

- Set the specified identity as verified (by setting `verified` to "true" or `verification_method` to "low")
- Unverify a verified identity (by setting `verified` to "false" or `verification_method` to "none")
- Update the `value` property of the specified identity

You can't change an identity's `primary` attribute with this endpoint. You must use the [Make Identity Primary](#make-identity-primary)
endpoint instead.

#### [](#allowed-for-3) Allowed For

#### [](#parameters-3) Parameters

| Name             | Type    | In   | Required | Description                 |
| ---------------- | ------- | ---- | -------- | --------------------------- |
| user_id          | integer | Path | true     | The id of the user          |

- `PUT /api/v2/users/{user_id}/identities/{user_identity_id}/make_primary`
- `PUT /api/v2/end_users/{user_id}/identities/{user_identity_id}/make_primary`

Sets the specified identity as primary. To change other attributes, use the [Update Identity](#update-identity)
endpoint. This is a collection-level operation and the correct behavior for an API client is to subsequently reload the entire collection.

The first endpoint is the preferred option if authenticating as an agent. If authenticating as an end user, you can only use the second endpoint. In addition, an end user can only make an email identity primary if the email is verified.

### [](#verify-identity) Verify Identity

- `PUT /api/v2/users/{user_id}/identities/{user_identity_id}/verify`

Sets the specified identity as verified.

For security reasons, you can't use this endpoint to update the email identity of the account owner. To verify the person's identity, send a verification email. See [Verifying the account owner's email address](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408828975130)
in Zendesk help.

If [automatic mapping of users to organizations using the email domain](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408882246298-Creating-organizations#topic_nxl_vdt_bc)
is enabled and the user is not already a member of an organization, they will be automatically added to the organization associated with the email domain once the email identity is verified.

- `DELETE /api/v2/users/{user_id}/identities/{user_identity_id}`
- `DELETE /api/v2/end_users/{user_id}/identities/{user_identity_id}`

Deletes the identity for a given user. In certain cases, a phone number associated with an identity is still visible on the user profile after the identity has been deleted via API. You can remove the phone number from the user profile by updating the `phone` attribute of the user to an empty string. See [Update User via API](/api-reference/ticketing/users/users/#update-user)
for details and examples.

Deleting identities with type `messaging` could break messaging functionality. For example, an agent may stop being able to send messages via the messaging channel.

================================================

# https://developer.zendesk.com/api-reference/ticketing/tickets/tickets/ - Tickets | Zendesk Developer Docszendev_horizontalzendev_horizontal with metadata date undefined

================================================
Tickets are the means through which your end users (customers) communicate with agents in Zendesk Support. Tickets can originate from a number of channels, including email, Help Center, chat, phone call, X (formerly Twitter), Facebook, or the API. All tickets have a core set of properties.

#### [](#tickets-and-requests) Tickets and Requests

Zendesk has both a Tickets API and a Requests API. A _ticket_ is an agent's perspective on a ticket. A _request_ is an end user's perspective on a ticket. End users can only see public comments and certain fields of a ticket. Therefore, use the [Requests API](/api-reference/ticketing/tickets/ticket-requests/)
to let end users view, update, and create tickets. Use the Tickets API described in the rest of this document to let agents and admins manage tickets.

#### [](#requesters-and-submitters) Requesters and submitters

Every ticket has a requester and submitter. The user who is asking for support through a ticket is the requester. For most businesses that use Zendesk Support, the requester is a customer, but requesters can also be agents in your Zendesk Support instance.

The submitter is the user who created a ticket. By default, the requester of a ticket is the submitter. For example, if your customer emails your support address, this creates a ticket with the customer as both the requester and submitter. The requester will also appear as the author of the ticket's first comment.

However, a support agent can also create a ticket on behalf of a customer. If an agent creates a ticket through the web interface, the agent is set as the submitter. This can be accomplished equivalently through the API by passing the agent's user ID as the `submitter_id` when creating a ticket. In this case, the agent, who is the submitter, becomes the author of the ticket's first comment and the ticket shows that the agent created the ticket "on behalf of" the customer.

If you want to include [placeholders](/api-reference/ticketing/tickets/ticket_comments/#bodies)
in the first comment, create the ticket as an agent, not on behalf of an end user. Placeholders only work in comments if the comment is created by an agent. If an end user tries to enter a placeholder in a comment, it's treated as a static string and is displayed as such in the ticket.

#### [](#the-submitter-is-always-the-first-comment-author) The submitter is always the first comment author

In the description above, we see that a ticket's first comment author can differ depending on who created the ticket. In both examples, whomever is the submitter becomes the first comment author. This will hold true for all tickets created in Zendesk Support with one exception.

Exception: If the ticket is created as a follow-up ticket (i.e., if the ticket is created using `via_followup_source_id`), then any `submitter_id` attribute is ignored. The API sets whoever created the follow-up ticket (for the API, always the authenticated user) as the first comment author.

#### [](#description-and-first-comment) Description and first comment

When creating a ticket, use the `comment` property to set the ticket description, which is also the first comment. Example:

**Important**: Do not use the `description` property to set the first comment. The property is for reading purposes only. While it's possible to use the property to set the first comment, the functionality has limitations and is provided to support existing implementations.

#### [](#subject) Subject

When tickets are created within the Agent Workspace, a `subject` is required. However, tickets can be created via the API or email without a subject. If a ticket doesn't have a subject, the text of the first comment is populated as the ticket's subject the first time the ticket is updated in the Agent Workspace.

#### [](#groups-and-assignees) Groups and assignees

Tickets in Zendesk Support can be passed to a group of agents unassigned, or to a specific agent in a specific group. A ticket can only be assigned to one assignee at a time.

#### [](#collaborators) Collaborators

Aside from the requester, a ticket can include other people in its communication, known as collaborators or cc's. Collaborators receive email notifications when tickets are updated. Collaborators can be either end users or agents.

#### [](#custom-ticket-statuses) Custom ticket statuses

If your account has [activated custom ticket statuses](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4412575841306)
, the `status` property contains the ticket's status category. An id for the custom ticket status is available in the `custom_status_id` property.

You can also include a `comment_count` property in the JSON objects returned by GET requests by sideloading it. Example:

`GET /api/v2/tickets.json?include=comment_count`

#### [](#example) Example

### [](#list-tickets) List Tickets

- `GET /api/v2/tickets`
- `GET /api/v2/organizations/{organization_id}/tickets`
- `GET /api/v2/users/{user_id}/tickets/requested`
- `GET /api/v2/users/{user_id}/tickets/ccd`
- `GET /api/v2/users/{user_id}/tickets/followed`
- `GET /api/v2/users/{user_id}/tickets/assigned`
- `GET /api/v2/tickets/recent`

`ccd` lists tickets that the specified user is cc'd on.

`followed` lists tickets that the specified user is following.

`recent` lists tickets that the requesting agent recently viewed in the agent interface, not recently created or updated tickets (unless by the agent recently in the agent interface).

When using the `requested`, `ccd`, `followed`, or `assigned` ticket endpoints with a request that includes both active and archived tickets, there may be a delay before newly created tickets become available in your results. Most ticket updates are available within 30 seconds and the vast majority will be available within 90 seconds. If a newly created ticket does not show up right away, wait a few minutes before trying again.

To get a list of all tickets in your account, use the [Incremental Ticket Export, Cursor Based](/api-reference/ticketing/ticket-management/incremental_exports/#incremental-ticket-export-cursor-based)
or [Incremental Ticket Export, Time Based](/api-reference/ticketing/ticket-management/incremental_exports/#incremental-ticket-export-time-based)
endpoint.

For more filter options, use the [Search API](/api-reference/ticketing/ticket-management/search/)
.

You can also sideload related records with the tickets. See [Side-Loading](/documentation/ticketing/using-the-zendesk-api/side_loading/)
.

Archived tickets are not included in the following endpoint responses. See [About archived tickets](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408887617050)
in the Zendesk help.

- `GET /api/v2/tickets`
- `GET /api/v2/organizations/{organization_id}/tickets`
- `GET /api/v2/tickets/recent`

If an agent with restricted access to tickets makes a request to the `api/v2/tickets` endpoint, the endpoint returns only the tickets the agent can access. For information on agents with restricted access to tickets, see [Creating custom roles and assigning agents](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408882153882)
. In addition, the restricted agent's request includes up to 10,000 tickets where the agent is a [CC or follower](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408822451482)
.

#### [](#allowed-for) Allowed for

- Agents

#### [](#pagination) Pagination

- Cursor pagination (recommended)
- Offset pagination

See [Pagination](/api-reference/introduction/pagination/)
.

Returns a maximum of 100 records per page.

#### [](#sorting) Sorting

By default, tickets are sorted by id from smallest to largest.

When using cursor pagination, use the following parameter to change the sort order:

| Name   | Type   | Required | Comments                                                                                                                 |
| ------ | ------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `sort` | string | no       | Possible values are "updated_at", "id", "status" (ascending order) or "-updated_at", "-id", "-status" (descending order) |

When using offset pagination, use the following parameters to change the sort order:

| Name         | Type   | Required | Comments                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------ | ------ | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `sort_by`    | string | no       | Possible values are "assignee", "assignee.name", "created_at", "group", "id", "requester", "requester.name", "status", "subject", "updated_at" |
| `sort_order` | string | no       | One of `asc`, `desc`. Defaults to `asc`                                                                                                        |

When sorting by creation date, the first ticket listed may not be the absolute oldest ticket in your account due to [ticket archiving](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408887617050)
.

The `query` parameter is not supported for this endpoint. Use the [Search API](/api-reference/ticketing/ticket-management/search/)
to narrow your results with `query`.

#### [](#parameters) Parameters

| Name        | Type   | In    | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                         |
| ----------- | ------ | ----- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| external_id | string | Query | false    | Lists tickets by external id. External ids don't have to be unique for each ticket. As a result, the request may return multiple tickets with the same external id. |

#### [](#limits) Limits

This endpoint has its own rate limit that is different from the account wide rate limit. When calls are made to this endpoint, this limit will be consumed and you will get a `429 Too Many Requests` response code if the allocation is exhausted.

##### [](#headers) Headers

API responses include usage limit information in the headers for this endpoint.

Within this header, “Total” signifies the initial allocation, “Remaining” indicates the remaining allowance for the current interval, and “Resets” denotes the wait time in seconds before the limit refreshes. You can see the Total, and Interval values in the below table.

##### [](#details) Details

This is the limit definition for the List Tickets endpoint

| Rate Limits                 | Scopes  | Interval | Sandbox | Trial | Default |
| --------------------------- | ------- | -------- | ------- | ----- | ------- |
| Standard                    | Account | 1 minute | 100     | 100   | N/A     |

- `GET /api/v2/users/{user_id}/tickets/ccd/count`
- `GET /api/v2/users/{user_id}/tickets/assigned/count`

Returns an approximate count of tickets in the account. If the count exceeds 100,000, it is updated every 24 hours.

`ccd` lists tickets that the specified user is cc'd on.

The `count[refreshed_at]` property is a timestamp that indicates when the count was last updated.

**Note**: When the count exceeds 100,000, `count[refreshed_at]` may occasionally be null. This indicates that the count is being updated in the background, and `count[value]` is limited to 100,000 until the update is complete.

### [](#create-ticket) Create Ticket

- `POST /api/v2/tickets`

Takes a `ticket` object that specifies the ticket properties. The only required property is `comment`. See [Ticket Comments](/api-reference/ticketing/tickets/ticket_comments/)
. All writable properties listed in [JSON Format](#json-format)
are optional.

To submit a ticket with HTML data in a comment, use `html_body` instead of `body` in your request. HTML data is stripped out of the request if you use `body`.

An `audit` object is generated and included in the response when you create or update a ticket. The `audit` object has an `events` array listing all the updates made to the new ticket. For more information, see [Ticket Audits](/api-reference/ticketing/tickets/ticket_audits/)
. You can also add your own metadata to the `audit` object. See [Setting metadata](/documentation/ticketing/managing-tickets/creating-and-updating-tickets#setting-metadata)
.

### [](#update-many-tickets) Update Many Tickets

- `PUT /api/v2/tickets/update_many`

Accepts an array of up to 100 ticket objects, or a comma-separated list of up to 100 ticket ids.

This endpoint returns a `job_status`[JSON object](/api-reference/ticketing/ticket-management/job_statuses/#json-format)
and queues a background job to do the work. Use the [Show Job Status](/api-reference/ticketing/ticket-management/job_statuses/#show-job-status)
endpoint to check for the job's completion. Only a certain number of jobs can be queued or running at the same time. See [Job limit](/api-reference/introduction/rate-limits/#job-limit)
for more information.

The system always performs safe updates for bulk and batch update jobs. This protects against record update collisions, such as updating tickets with outdated ticket data, and notifies you if one occurs. For bulk ticket updates, you can specify `safe_update` and `updated_stamp` properties to set your own safe update time; if you don't specify `updated_stamp`, the system uses the timestamp when the bulk update was queued. For batch ticket updates, you must specify both `safe_update` and `updated_stamp` if specifying your own safe update time; failing to include `updated_stamp` results in an error. For more information, see [Protecting against ticket update collisions](/documentation/ticketing/managing-tickets/creating-and-updating-tickets#protecting-against-ticket-update-collisions)
.

#### [](#bulk-updates) Bulk updates

================================================

# https://developer.zendesk.com/api-reference/ticketing/users/events-api/events-api/ - Events API | Zendesk Developer Docszendev_horizontalzendev_horizontal with metadata date undefined

================================================
The Events API lets you build a timeline of all your customers' interactions from any source. An event can be any programmatic event that your application or system can associate with a user. Examples include purchase transactions, website visits, or customer service interactions.

Each event is associated with a customer who triggered the event.

The Events API is available on the Suite Team plan and above. It is activated in the Admin Center by an admin.

In addition to this API reference, the following resources are available in the Develop Help Center:

- To get started, see [Getting started with Sunshine user events](/documentation/ticketing/events/getting-started-with-events)
  in the Develop Help Center
- To learn more about using the API, see the [Events API developer guide](/documentation/ticketing/events/about-the-events-api/)
- To ask questions, provide answers, and join discussions, visit the [Zendesk APIs community](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/community/topics/1260801854210)

### Run in Postman

If you use Postman, you can import the Sunshine Events API endpoints as a collection into your Postman app, then try out different requests to learn how the API works. Click the following button to get started:

[](https://god.gw.postman.com/run-collection/19931619-678e0310-0069-43b1-a7af-6c9414c45f48?action=collection/fork&collection-url=entityId=19931619-678e0310-0069-43b1-a7af-6c9414c45f48&entityType=collection&workspaceId=cfe0e8e6-42d1-4f46-a048-90e2caae5a05)

If you don't use Postman, you can sign up for a free account on the [Postman website](https://identity.getpostman.com/signup)
and download the app. For more information about using Postman with Zendesk APIs, see [Exploring Zendesk APIs with Postman](/documentation/api-basics/working-with-the-zendesk-apis/exploring-zendesk-apis-with-postman/)
.

### [](#json-format) JSON format

Events are represented as JSON objects with the following properties:

| Name        | Type   | Read-only | Mandatory | Description                                                                                                                                                                          |

| source      | string | false     | true      | Application which sent the event. Note: 'zendesk' is a protected source name for Zendesk standard events. Any attempts to use this source when creating an event results in an error |
| type        | string | false     | true      | Event name                                                                                                                                                                           |

An event consists of a JSON object describing both the event and the user who triggered the event.

| Name    | Type   | Required | Description                                                                                                                                        |

### [](#get-events-by-sunshine-profile) Get Events by Sunshine Profile

- `GET /api/v2/user_profiles/events?identifier={identifier}`

Returns events for a Sunshine profile.

To locate the specific profile, you must specify an identifier query as a URL parameter in a request. For more information, see [Identifier queries](/api-reference/ticketing/users/profiles_api/profiles_api/#identifier-queries)
.

You can also include any of the following optional query string parameters in the format of `filter[{optional parameter}]=`:

- **source** - Include only events of the specified source. For example, `filter[source]=amazon`
- **type** - Include only events of the specified type for a given event source. For example, `filter[source]=amazon&filter[type]=checkout`
- **start_time** - Include only events with a later or equal to `filter[created_at]` time
- **end_time** - Include only events with an earlier or equal to `filter[created_at]` time

`page[size]` specifies the number of events. Note, it is a parameter in itself and not a `filter[]` parameter value.

To understand how to use the optional `filter[]` path parameter, see [Filtering Sunshine events](/documentation/custom-data/events/filtering-events)
.

The query string must be url-encoded before sending the request. In cURL, use the `--data-urlencode` option with the `-G` flag. The `-G` flag forces the command to make a GET request instead of a default POST request.

# https://developer.zendesk.com/api-reference/ticketing/users/profiles_api/profiles_api/ - Profiles API | Zendesk Developer Docszendev_horizontalzendev_horizontal with metadata date undefined

================================================
The Profiles API allows you to create a single view of a customer across applications and systems. A profile can contain the various identities of a user in different applications and systems.

This API has a direct relationship to a [Zendesk user](/api-reference/ticketing/users/users/)
.

The Profiles API is available on the Suite Team plan and above. It is activated in the Admin Center by an admin.

In addition to this API reference, the following resources are available:

- To get started, see [Getting started with profiles](/documentation/ticketing/profiles/getting-started-with-profiles/)
  in the Develop Help Center
- To learn more about using the API, see the [Profiles API developer guide](/documentation/ticketing/profiles/about-the-profiles-api/)
- To ask questions, provide answers, and join discussions, visit the [Zendesk API community](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/community/topics/1260801854210-Zendesk-APIs)

### Run in Postman

If you use Postman, you can import the Sunshine Profiles API endpoints as a collection into your Postman app, then try out different requests to learn how the API works. Click the following button to get started:

and download the app. For more information about using Postman with Zendesk APIs, see [Exploring Zendesk APIs with Postman](/documentation/api-basics/working-with-the-zendesk-apis/exploring-zendesk-apis-with-postman/)
.

### [](#json-format) JSON format

Profiles are represented as JSON objects with the following properties:

| Name        | Type   | Read-only | Mandatory | Description                                                                                                    |
| ----------- | ------ | --------- | --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| attributes  | object | false     | true      | [JSON schema compliant](https://json-schema.org/) object containing details about the profile                  |
| created_at  | string | true      | false     | An auto-generated datetime of when the object was updated                                                      |
| id          | string | true      | false     | Profile ID                                                                                                     |
| identifiers | array  | false     | true      | The identifier for the application or system where the identity is used                                        |
| name        | string | false     | false     | The person's name for the profile                                                                              |
| source      | string | false     | true      | The application or system associated to the profile. Note that the value 'zendesk' is reserved for future use. |
| type        | string | false     | true      | The profile type                                                                                               |
| updated_at  | string | true      | false     | An auto-generated datetime of when the object was updated                                                      |
| user_id     | string | false     | false     | Zendesk user ID that the profile belongs to                                                                    |

#### [](#identifiers-array) Identifiers array

The `identifiers` array consists of one or more values used to identify a person in an application or system. Each identifier consists of a `type` and a `value` property which are arbitrary. For example, an identifier can be of `type` "member_id" with a `value` of "0634335".

#### [](#standard-identifiers) Standard identifiers

It is recommended to submit the identifier types email, Facebook, phone, SDK, X (formerly Twitter), or external ID as "email", "facebook", "phone_number", "sdk", "twitter", and "external_id", respectively. If a Zendesk user identity has been previously created with a "google" type property, it will be internally matched with an identifier type of "email". When the value for identifier types "email" and "twitter" are added or modified, any upper case letters are automatically converted to lower case.

Each profile is associated with a Zendesk user. When creating a profile, the API first looks for a Zendesk user who has a [Zendesk identity](/api-reference/ticketing/users/user_identities/)
that matches a standard identifier in the new profile. If a match is found, it associates the profile to the Zendesk user by Zendesk user id (user_id). If no match is found, it creates an anonymous Zendesk user and associates the profile to the user by Zendesk user id.

If the `name` in the `profile` object is not provided, the value of an identifier type will be used for the profile name according to the following rules:

| Identifier type used | If type not present | Profile name                                                                 | Example                |
| -------------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| "email"              | email address       | "[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#f89e9797b89a998ad69e9797) " |
| "external_id"        | "email"             | "User " + external id                                                        | "User FooBar123"       |
| "phone_number"       | "external_id"       | "User " + phone number                                                       | "User 0411 555 666"    |
| "twitter"            | "phone_number"      | "Twitter user " + username                                                   | "Twitter user FooBar"  |
| "facebook"           | "twitter"           | "Facebook user " + username                                                  | "Facebook user FooBar" |
| "sdk"                | "facebook"          | "SDK user " + sdk value                                                      | "SDK user FooBarSDK"   |

If none of the listed identifier types are present, the first identifier present in the `identifiers` object is used. The profile name is set as the identifier's "{`type`} user {`value`}". Example: 'Shado user FooBar'.

**Note**: Any email, phone, Facebook, SDK or X identifier added to a profile is automatically added as an identity to the user in Zendesk Support. Any external ID identifier added to a profile is automatically added as the external_id attribute on the Zendesk user. Please verify the identifier type belongs to the user before creating a profile or submitting changes.

#### [](#example) Example

### [](#identifier-queries) Identifier queries

You can reference profile records in Zendesk using identifier queries. You specify an identifier query as a URL parameter in a request.

An identifier query contains the necessary information to find a match of profile records within our system. You must specify a profile source, profile type, identifier type, and identifier value with `:` as the delimiter:

================================================

# https://developer.zendesk.com/api-reference/ticketing/users/user_fields/ - User Fields | Zendesk Developer Docszendev_horizontalzendev_horizontal with metadata date undefined

================================================
You can use this API to add fields to the user profile page in the Zendesk user interface. Basic text fields, date fields, as well as customizable drop-down and number fields are available. The fields correspond to the user fields that admins can add using the Zendesk admin interface. See [Adding custom fields to users](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203662066)
in Zendesk help.

The fields are only visible to agents and admins.

**About dropdown and multiselect fields**

Most custom fields let agents enter a single value such as free-form text or a date. The dropdown field lets agents choose a single value from a list of options. The multiselect field lets agents choose one or more values from a list of options. Each option has a name that's visible to the agent and an underlying value that's not visible. In the API, these options are listed in the dropdown and multiselect field's `custom_field_options` property. Each option in the list has a `name` and `value` property.

In the Zendesk admin interface, the "Value" field corresponds to the `name` property and the "Tag" field corresponds to the `value` property.

Occasionally, a `value` can be duplicated through API requests. When this happens, the field becomes uneditable until the duplicated value is removed.

- All options must be passed on update. Options that are not passed will be removed. As a result, these values will be removed from any organizations.
- To create a new option, pass a null `id` along with `name` and `value`.
- To update an existing option, pass its `id` along with `name` and `value`.
- To re-order an option, reposition it in the `custom_field_options` array relative to the other options.
- To remove an option, omit it from the list of options upon update.

================================================

# https://developer.zendesk.com/api-reference/ticketing/users/users/ - Users | Zendesk Developer Docszendev_horizontalzendev_horizontal with metadata date undefined

================================================
Zendesk Support has three types of users: end users (your customers), agents, and administrators.

#### [](#end-users) End users

End users request support through tickets. End users have access to Help Center where they can view knowledge base articles and community content, access their ticket history, and submit new tickets.

#### [](#agents) Agents

Agents work in Zendesk Support to solve tickets. Agents can be divided into multiple groups and can also belong to multiple groups. Agents don't have access to administrative configuration in Zendesk Support such as business rules or automations, but can configure their own macros and views.

#### [](#administrators) Administrators

Administrators have all the abilities of agents, plus administrative abilities. Accounts on the Enterprise plan and above can configure custom roles to give agents varying degrees of administrative access.

#### [](#listing-requested-tickets-and-cced-tickets) Listing Requested Tickets and CC'ed Tickets

Use the Tickets API to list:

- [tickets requested by a user](/api-reference/ticketing/tickets/tickets/#list-tickets)
- [tickets on which a user is cc'ed](/api-reference/ticketing/tickets/tickets/#list-tickets)

#### [](#listing-help-center-content-by-a-user) Listing Help Center Content by a User

Use the Help Center API to list:

- [articles](/api-reference/help_center/help-center-api/articles/#list-articles)
  and [article comments](/api-reference/help_center/help-center-api/article_comments/#list-comments)
  created by a user
- [community posts](/api-reference/help_center/help-center-api/posts/#list-posts)
  and [post comments](/api-reference/help_center/help-center-api/post_comments/#list-comments)
  created by a user

### [](#json-format) JSON format

#### [](#email-address) Email Address

You can specify a user's primary email address when you create the user. See [Specifying email and verified attributes](/api-reference/ticketing/users/users/#specifying-email-and-verified-attributes)
.

To update a user's primary email address, use the [Make Identity Primary](/api-reference/ticketing/users/user_identities#make-identity-primary)
endpoint.

#### [](#time-zone) Time Zone

A `time_zone` name consists of a string such as "Eastern Time (US & Canada)". For a list of valid names, click [https://support.zendesk.com/api/v2/time_zones](https://support.zendesk.com/api/v2/time_zones)
. For details, see [Time Zones](/api-reference/introduction/data-types/#time-zones)
.

Request body in User API:

#### [](#user-fields) User Fields

You can use the `user_fields` object to set the value of one or more custom fields in the user's profile. Specify [field keys](/api-reference/ticketing/users/user_fields/#json-format)
as the properties to set. Example:

For more information, see [User Fields](/api-reference/ticketing/users/user_fields/)
and [Adding custom fields to users](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203662066)
.

#### [](#phone-number) Phone Number

The phone number should comply with the E.164 international [telephone numbering plan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.164)
. Example `+15551234567`. E164 numbers are international numbers with a country dial prefix, usually an area code and a subscriber number. A valid E.164 phone number must include a [country calling code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_country_calling_codes)
.

A phone number can be one of the following types:

- A direct line linked to a single user, which is indicated by a `shared_phone_number` attribute of false. A direct line can be used as a [user identity](/api-reference/ticketing/users/user_identities)
- A shared number linked to multiple users, indicated by a `shared_phone_number` attribute of true. A shared number can not be used as a [user identity](/api-reference/ticketing/users/user_identities)

See [Understanding how phone numbers are linked to end-user profiles](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/230553307#topic_hz3_5nm_sx)
in the Support Help Center.

#### [](#organization-id) Organization ID

The `organization_id` property returns the id of the user's organization. If the user has more than one organization memberships, the id of the user's default organization is returned.

The field is writable. However, if you make a request to update the `organization_id` property, the `organization_id` of the request updates the default organization for that user and removes all other organizations currently associated with that user. Zendesk recommends using the [Organization Memberships API](/api-reference/ticketing/organizations/organization_memberships/)
to add or delete organizations for a user.

#### [](#json-format-for-end-users) JSON Format for End Users

When an end user makes the request, the user is returned with the following attributes:

- `GET /api/v2/users/me`

The endpoint returns [user information](/api-reference/ticketing/users/users/)
and an `authenticity_token`.

#### [](#allowed-for-7) Allowed For

- Anonymous users

#### [](#authenticity-token) Authenticity Token

Zendesk API calls made by end users from a Zendesk help center must include `authenticity_token` in the `X-CSRF-Token` HTTP header. This helps prevent [cross-site request forgery (CSRF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery)
attacks.

For an example using an authenticity token, see the AJAX request in the [Upgrading from Templating API v1](https://developer.zendesk.com/documentation/help_center/help-center-templates/v1#jquery)
documentation.

### [](#create-user) Create User

- `POST /api/v2/users`

#### [](#skip-verification-email) Skip verification email

If you need to create users without sending out a verification email, include a `"skip_verify_email": true` property.

#### [](#user-role) User role

If you don't specify a `role` parameter, the new user is assigned the role of end user.

If you need to create agents with a specific role, the `role` property only accepts three possible values: "end-user", "agent", and "admin". Therefore, set `role` to "agent" as well as add a new property called `custom_role_id` and give it the actual desired role ID from your Zendesk Support account. This applies to the built-in light agent role of Zendesk Support as well.

If you set `role` to "end-user" but include a `custom_role_id` value, `role` will be set to "agent".

#### [](#create-user-with-multiple-identities) Create User with Multiple Identities

If you have a user with multiple identities, such as email addresses and X (formerly Twitter) accounts, you can also include these values at creation time by including an `identities` array where each identity in the array has a `type` and `value` property. Example: `{"type": "email", "value": ""}`. This is especially useful when importing users from another system.

- `POST /api/v2/users/create_or_update`

Creates a user if the user does not already exist, or updates an existing user identified by e-mail address or external ID.

If you don't specify a role parameter, the new user is assigned the role of end user.

If you need to create users without sending out a verification email, include a `"skip_verify_email": true` property in the body.

#### [](#external-id-case-sensitivity) External ID Case Sensitivity

When providing an external id to identify an existing user to update, the search for the user record is not case sensitive.

However, if an existing user is found, the system will update the user's external id to match the case of the external id used to find the user.

#### [](#response-status-code) Response Status Code

- If the user exists in Zendesk, a successful request returns a 200 status code with "Location: /api/v2/users/{user_id}.json".

##### [](#headers) Headers

API responses include usage limit information in the headers for this endpoint.

Within this header, “Total” signifies the initial allocation, “Remaining” indicates the remaining allowance for the current interval, and “Resets” denotes the wait time in seconds before the limit refreshes. You can see the Total, and Interval values in the below table.

##### [](#details) Details

The rate limit is 5 requests per minute for each unique end user profile. For example, you can make 1 call per second as long as you make five calls for one user and five calls for another user. The rate limiting mechanism behaves as described in [Usage Limits](/api-reference/introduction/rate-limits/#monitoring-your-request-activity)
in the API introduction. Zendesk recommends that you obey the Retry-After header values.

Rate limit for creating or updating a single user. If you need to update many users, consider the create_or_update_many endpoint.

| Rate Limits | Scopes  | Interval | Sandbox | Trial | Default |
| ----------- | ------- | -------- | ------- | ----- | ------- |
| Standard    | Account | 1 second | 1       | 1     | 1       |

================================================
Just as agents can be segmented into groups in Zendesk Support, your customers (end-users) can be segmented into organizations. You can manually assign customers to an organization or automatically assign them to an organization by their email address domain. Organizations can be used in business rules to route tickets to groups of agents or to send email notifications.

================================================

# https://developer.zendesk.com/api-reference/ticketing/organizations/organization_fields/ - Organization Fields | Zendesk Developer Docszendev_horizontalzendev_horizontal with metadata date undefined

================================================
You can use this API to add fields to the Organization page in the Zendesk user interface. Basic text fields, date fields, as well as customizable drop-down and number fields are available. The fields correspond to the organization fields that admins can add using the Zendesk admin interface. See [Adding custom fields to organizations](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203662076)
in Zendesk help.

The fields are only visible to agents and admins.

**About dropdown and multiselect fields**

Most custom fields let agents enter a single value such as free-form text or a date. The dropdown field lets agents choose a single value from a list of options. The multiselect field lets agents choose one or more values from a list of options. Each option has a name that's visible to the agent and an underlying value that's not visible. In the API, these options are listed in the dropdown and multiselect field's `custom_field_options` property. Each option in the list has a `name` and `value` property.

In the Zendesk admin interface, the "Value" field corresponds to the `name` property and the "Tag" field corresponds to the `value` property.

Occasionally, a `value` can be duplicated through API requests. When this happens, the field becomes uneditable until the duplicated value is removed.

### [](#json-format) JSON format

Organization Fields are represented as JSON objects with the following properties:

| Name                     | Type    | Read-only | Mandatory | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

# https://developer.zendesk.com/api-reference/ticketing/lookup_relationships/lookup_relationships/ - Lookup Relationships | Zendesk Developer Docszendev_horizontalzendev_horizontal with metadata date undefined

================================================
A lookup relationship field is a custom field whose `type` is "lookup". This type of custom field gives you the ability to create a relationship from a source object to a target object. One example is a ticket lookup field called "Success Manager" that references a user. The source object is a ticket and the target object is a user. To learn more, see [Using lookup relationship fields](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4591924111770)
in Zendesk help.

You can create `definitions` that specify what type of objects will show up in the autocomplete endpoints when populating the field. The filter is not used to validate the relationship; it's used as a convenience to filter the target records that you want to see. For example, if your field was "Success Manager", you could define a filter that says "only show users who are agents".

#### [](#setting-lookup-field-values) Setting lookup field values

- To set by id, provide the target record's id. Example: `"my_lookup_field": "123"`.
- To set by external id, provide an external id prefixed with the string `external_id:`. Example: `"my_lookup_field": "external_id:ABCDE"`. Note: The external id is used to retrieve the target record and then the id is stored as the lookup field value.
- To set by name, provide a name prefixed with the string `name:`. The `is_unique` property on the custom object's name field must be enabled. Example: `"my_lookup_field": "name:car1"`. Note: The name is used to retrieve the target record and then the id is stored as the lookup field value.

### [](#creating-lookup-relationship-fields) Creating lookup relationship fields

Use the following endpoints to create lookup relationship fields for tickets, users, and organizations:

- [Create Ticket Field](/api-reference/ticketing/tickets/ticket_fields/#create-ticket-field)
- [Create User Field](/api-reference/ticketing/users/user_fields/#create-user-field)
- [Create Organization Field](/api-reference/ticketing/organizations/organization_fields/#create-organization-field)

Set the following properties to create a lookup relationship field:

- `type` (required) - Must be "lookup"
- `relationship_target_type` (required) - The object type that you want to store. One of "zen:user", "zen:ticket", "zen:organization", or "zen:custom_object:CUSTOM_OBJECT_KEY". For example "zen:user" will list user records or "zen:custom_object:apartment" will list apartment records. You can't change the value of this property after creating the field
- `relationship_filter` (optional) - A condition that defines a subset of records as the options in your lookup relationship field. See [Filtering the field's options](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4591924111770#topic_t14_w3l_5tb)
  in Zendesk help and [Conditions reference](/documentation/ticketing/reference-guides/conditions-reference/)

#### [](#using-curl) Using cURL

The following example creates a lookup relationship ticket field that references users.

### [](#get-sources-by-target) Get sources by target

- `GET /api/v2/{target_type}/{target_id}/relationship_fields/{field_id}/{source_type}`

Returns a list of source objects whose values are populated with the id of a related target object. For example, if you have a lookup field called "Success Manager" on a ticket, this endpoint can answer the question, "What tickets (sources) is this user (found by `target_type` and `target_id`) assigned as the 'Success Manager' (field referenced by `field_id`)?"

# https://developer.zendesk.com/api-reference/ticketing/groups/groups/ - Groups | Zendesk Developer Docszendev_horizontalzendev_horizontal with metadata date undefined

================================================
When support requests arrive in Zendesk Support, they can be assigned to a group. Groups serve as the core element of ticket workflow; support agents are organized into groups and tickets can be assigned to a group only, or to an assigned agent within a group. A ticket can never be assigned to an agent without also being assigned to a group.

### [](#json-format) JSON format

Groups are represented as JSON objects with the following properties:

.

**Note**: It can take up to a few minutes for new tickets, users, and other resources to be indexed for search. If new resources don't appear in your search results, wait a few minutes and try again.

### [](#results-limit) Results limit

The Search API returns up to 1,000 results per query, with a maximum of 100 results per page. See [Pagination](/api-reference/introduction/pagination/)
. If you request a page past the limit (`page=11` at 100 results per page), a 422 Insufficient Resource Error is returned.

If you need to retrieve large datasets, Zendesk recommends breaking up the search into smaller chunks by limiting results to a specific date range. You can also use the [Export Search Results](/api-reference/ticketing/ticket-management/search/#export-search-results)
endpoint.

Alternatively, if you only want incremental changes based on the most recent change, consider using one of the [Incremental Export](/api-reference/ticketing/ticket-management/incremental_exports/)
endpoints.

The `count` property shows the actual number of results. For example, if a query has 5,000 results, the `count` value will be 5,000, even if the API only returns the first 1,000 results.

### [](#query-syntax) Query syntax

The search endpoint has a `query` parameter:

`.../api/v2/search.json?query={search_string}`

The `query` parameter value supports a syntax that lets you specify resource types and criteria. For example, you can search for "users named Jane Doe" or "tickets with an open status".

For more information about the query syntax and examples, see [Searching with the Zendesk API](/documentation/ticketing/using-the-zendesk-api/searching-with-the-zendesk-api)
.

#### [](#side-loading) Side-loading

The Search API supports side-loading, which lets you retrieve related records as part of a single request. To make the request, add an `include` parameter specifying the associations you want to load.

For example, the following request searches for records that contain "help" and specifies the type `tickets` to sideload the ticket's user data.

For more information, see [Side-Loading](/documentation/ticketing/using-the-zendesk-api/side_loading/)
.

### [](#json-format) JSON format

Search are represented as JSON objects with the following properties:

| Name          | Type    | Read-only | Mandatory | Description                                                                                                               |
| ------------- | ------- | --------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| count         | integer | true      | false     | The number of resources returned by the query corresponding to this page of results in the paginated response             |
| facets        | string  | true      | false     | The facets corresponding to the search query                                                                              |
| next_page     | string  | true      | false     | URL to the next page of results                                                                                           |
| previous_page | string  | true      | false     | URL to the previous page of results                                                                                       |
| results       | array   | true      | false     | May consist of tickets, users, groups, or organizations, as specified by the `result_type` property in each result object |

#### [](#example) Example

### [](#list-search-results) List Search Results

- `GET /api/v2/search?query={query}`

Returns the search results. See [Query basics](#query-basics)
for the syntax of the `query` parameter.

Use the ampersand character (&) to append the `sort_by` or `sort_order` parameters to the URL.

For examples, see [Searching with Zendesk API](/documentation/ticketing/using-the-zendesk-api/searching-with-the-zendesk-api)
.

#### [](#allowed-for) Allowed For

- Agents

#### [](#pagination) Pagination

- Offset pagination only

Offset pagination may result in duplicate results when paging. You can also use the [Export Search Results](/api-reference/ticketing/ticket-management/search/#export-search-results)
endpoint, which uses cursor-based pagination and doesn't return duplicate results. See [Using cursor pagination](/api-reference/introduction/pagination/#using-cursor-pagination)
for more information.

#### [](#errors-json-format) Errors JSON Format

Errors are represented as JSON objects which have the following keys:

| Name        | Type   | Comment                                               |
| ----------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| error       | string | The type of error. Examples: "unavailable", "invalid" |
| description | string |

##### [](#example-error) Example Error

#### [](#parameters) Parameters

| ---------- | ------ | ----- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| query      | string | Query | true     | The search query. See [Query basics](#query-basics) above. For details on the query syntax, see the [Zendesk Support search reference](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203663226) |
| sort_by    | string | Query | false    | One of `updated_at`, `created_at`, `priority`, `status`, or `ticket_type`. Defaults to sorting by relevance                                                                                     |
| sort_order | string | Query | false    | One of `asc` or `desc`. Defaults to `desc`                                                                                                                                                      |

#### [](#limits) Limits

This endpoint has its own rate limit that is different from the account wide rate limit. When calls are made to this endpoint, this limit will be consumed and you will get a `429 Too Many Requests` response code if the allocation is exhausted.

##### [](#headers) Headers

API responses include usage limit information in the headers for this endpoint.

Within this header, “Total” signifies the initial allocation, “Remaining” indicates the remaining allowance for the current interval, and “Resets” denotes the wait time in seconds before the limit refreshes. You can see the Total, and Interval values in the below table.

##### [](#details) Details

Rate limit definition for the search index API.

| Rate Limits                 | Scopes  | Interval | Sandbox | Trial | Default |
| --------------------------- | ------- | -------- | ------- | ----- | ------- |
| Standard                    | Account | 1 minute | N/A     | N/A   | 2500    |
| With High Volume API Add On | Account | 1 minute | N/A     | N/A   | 2500    |

"Default" applies to all Zendesk suite and support plans. Please refer to the [general account limits](https://developer.zendesk.com/api-reference/introduction/rate-limits)
for more information.

Returns the number of items matching the query rather than the items. The search string works the same as a regular search.

#### [](#allowed-for-1) Allowed For

- Agents

#### [](#parameters-1) Parameters

| Name  | Type   | In    | Required | Description      |

### [](#export-search-results) Export Search Results

- `GET /api/v2/search/export?query={query}`

Exports a set of results. See [Query syntax](#query-syntax)
for the syntax of the `query` parameter.

Use this endpoint for search queries that will return more than 1000 results. The result set is ordered only by the `created_at` attribute.

The search only returns results of a single object type. The following object types are supported: ticket, organization, user, or group.

You must specify the type in the `filter[type]` parameter. Searches with type in the query string will result in an error.

#### [](#allowed-for-2) Allowed For

- Agents

#### [](#pagination-1) Pagination

- Cursor pagination

See [Pagination](/api-reference/introduction/pagination/)
.

Returns a maximum of 1000 records per page. The number of results shown in a page is determined by the `page[size]` parameter.

**Note**: You may experience a speed reduction or a timeout if you request 1000 results per page and you have many archived tickets in the results. Try reducing the number of results per page. We recommend 100 results per page.

The cursor specified by the `after_cursor` property in a response expires after one hour.

For more information on cursor-based pagination, see the following articles:

- [Comparing cursor pagination and offset pagination](/documentation/developer-tools/pagination/comparing-cursor-pagination-and-offset-pagination)
- [Paginating through lists using cursor pagination](/documentation/developer-tools/pagination/paginating-through-lists-using-cursor-pagination)

#### [](#limits-1) Limits

This API endpoint is rate-limited to 100 requests per minute per account. The limit also counts towards the global API rate limit.

#### [](#response-format) Response Format

| Name               | Type   | Comment                                                                                              |
| ------------------ | ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| links[next]        | string | URL to the next page of results                                                                      |
| meta[has_more]     | string | Boolean indicating if there are more results                                                         |
| meta[after_cursor] | string | Cursor object returned from the Search Service                                                       |
| results            | array  | May consist of tickets, users, groups, or organizations, as specified by the `filter_type` parameter |

The response is similar to the response of `GET /api/v2/search.json?`, with a few changes:

- `links` - Has the following nested properties: `prev` and `next`. These replace the `next_page` and `prev_page` links. The `prev` property is always null because backward pagination is not supported. The `next` property may include an auto-generated link to the next page of results.
- `meta` - Has the following nested properties: `has_more` and `after_cursor`. The `has_more` property indicates whether the next page has more results. The `after_cursor` property is the cursor used to paginate to the next page. It expires after one hour.

There's no `count` property.

================================================
Use the incremental export API to get items that changed or were created in Zendesk Support since the last request. It works something like this:

- **Request at 5pm**: "Give me all the tickets that changed since noon today."
- **Response**: "Here are the tickets that changed since noon up until, and including, 5pm."
- **Request at 7pm**: "Give me the tickets that changed since 5pm."
- **Response**: "Here are the tickets that changed since 5pm up until, and including, 7pm."

To learn more, see the following topics in [Using the Incremental Export API](/documentation/ticketing/managing-tickets/using-the-incremental-export-api/)
:

- [Excluding deleted tickets](/documentation/ticketing/managing-tickets/using-the-incremental-export-api/#excluding-deleted-tickets)

#### [](#rate-limits) Rate limits

You can make up to 10 requests per minute to these endpoints.

The rate limiting mechanism behaves identically to the one described in [Rate limits](/api-reference/introduction/rate-limits/#monitoring-your-request-activity)
. We recommend using the `Retry-After` header value as described in [Catching errors caused by rate limiting](/documentation/ticketing/using-the-zendesk-api/best-practices-for-avoiding-rate-limiting#catch)
.

### [](#json-format) JSON Format

The exported items are represented as JSON objects. The format depends on the exported resource and pagination type, but all have the following additional common attribute:

| Name          | Type    | Comment                                                                                          |
| ------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| end_of_stream | boolean | true if the current request has returned all the results up to the current time; false otherwise |

To test the response format of an incremental export for a specific resource, you can run a sample export that returns only up to 50 results per request. See [Incremental Sample Export](#incremental-sample-export)
.

#### [](#cursor-based-pagination-json-format) Cursor-based Pagination JSON Format

| Name          | Type   | Comment                                                                                      |
| ------------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| after_url     | string | URL to fetch the next page of results                                                        |
| after_cursor  | string | Cursor to fetch the next page of results                                                     |
| before_url    | string | URL to fetch the previous page of results. If there's no previous page, the value is null    |
| before_cursor | string | Cursor to fetch the previous page of results. If there's no previous page, the value is null |

#### [](#time-based-pagination-json-format) Time-based Pagination JSON Format

| Name      | Type    | Comment                                                                                                                                  |
| --------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| end_time  | date    | The most recent time present in the result set expressed as a Unix epoch time. Use as the `start_time` to fetch the next page of results |
| next_page | string  | URL to fetch the next page of results                                                                                                    |
| count     | integer | The number of results returned for the current request                                                                                   |

### [](#query-string-parameters) Query String Parameters

| Name            | Required    | Comment                                                                                                                                                   |
| --------------- | ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| start_time      | yes         | A start time expressed as a Unix epoch time. See [start_time](#start_time)                                                                                |
| cursor          | cursor only | A cursor pointer. See [cursor](#cursor)                                                                                                                   |
| per_page        | no          | Number of results to return per page, up to a maximum of 1,000. If the parameter is not specified, the default number is 1,000. See [per_page](#per_page) |
| include         | no          | The name of a resource to side-load. See [include](#include)                                                                                              |
| exclude_deleted | no          | Whether or not you'd like to exclude deleted tickets from the response. See [exclude_deleted](#exclude_deleted)                                           |

#### [](#start_time) start_time

Specifies a time expressed as a [Unix epoch time](http://www.epochconverter.com/)
. All endpoints require a `start_time` parameter for the initial export. Example:

`GET /api/v2/incremental/tickets/cursor.json?start_time=1532034771`

The `start_time` of the initial export is arbitrary. The time must be more than one minute in the past to avoid missing data. To prevent race conditions, the ticket and ticket event export endpoints will not return data for the most recent minute.

When using [time-based incremental exports](/documentation/ticketing/managing-tickets/using-the-incremental-export-api#time-based-incremental-exports)
, subsequent pages and exports use the `start_time` parameter.

When using [cursor-based incremental exports](/documentation/ticketing/managing-tickets/using-the-incremental-export-api/#cursor-based-incremental-exports)
, the `start_time` parameter is only used in the initial request. Subsequent pages and exports use the [`cursor`](#cursor)
parameter.

#### [](#cursor) cursor

Specifies a cursor pointer when using cursor-based exports. The `cursor` parameter is used to fetch the next page of results or to make the next export. The `start_time` parameter is used once to fetch the initial page of the initial export, then `cursor` is used for subsequent pages and exports.

The `cursor` parameter is only supported for [incremental ticket exports](#incremental-ticket-export-cursor-based)
.

Example:

See [Paginating through lists using cursor pagination](/documentation/developer-tools/pagination/paginating-through-lists-using-cursor-pagination/)
for more details.

#### [](#per_page) per_page

Specifies the number of results to be returned per page, up to a maximum of 1,000. The default is 1,000. The following incremental exports support the `per_page` parameter:

- [tickets](#incremental-ticket-export-cursor-based)
- [ticket events](#incremental-ticket-event-export)
- [users (time-based)](#incremental-user-export-time-based)
- [users (cursor-based)](#incremental-user-export-cursor-based)
- [organizations (time-based)](#incremental-organization-export)

Example:

If requests are slow or begin to time out, the page size might be too large. Use the `per_page` parameter to reduce the number of results per page. We recommend progressively backing-off on the `per_page` parameter after each time out.

**Note**: In time-based exports, the system may exceed the 1000-item default return limit if items share the same timestamp. If exporting tickets, using cursor-based pagination can fix this issue.

#### [](#include) include

Side-loads other resources. The following incremental exports support the `include` parameter:

- [tickets](#incremental-ticket-export-cursor-based)
- [ticket events](#incremental-ticket-event-export)
- [users](#incremental-user-export-cursor-based)
- [organizations](#incremental-organization-export)

Add an `include` query parameter specifying the associations you want to load. Example:

See [Side-Loading](/documentation/ticketing/using-the-zendesk-api/side_loading/)
in the core API docs as well as any specific sideloading information in the endpoint docs below.

**Note**: The `last_audits` side-load is not supported on incremental endpoints for performance reasons.

#### [](#exclude_deleted) exclude_deleted

If true, excludes deleted tickets from the response. By default, deletions will appear in the ticket stream. If used in combination with the [Incremental Ticket Export](#incremental-ticket-export-cursor-based)
, you can separate your deleted ticket activity from your live data.

Example:

### [](#incremental-ticket-metric-event-export) Incremental Ticket Metric Event Export

See [List Ticket Metric Events](/api-reference/ticketing/tickets/ticket_metric_events/#list-ticket-metric-events)
.

### [](#incremental-article-export) Incremental Article Export

See [List Articles](/api-reference/help_center/help-center-api/articles/#list-articles)
in the Help Center API docs.

### [](#incremental-ticket-export-cursor-based) Incremental Ticket Export, Cursor Based

- `GET /api/v2/incremental/tickets/cursor?start_time={start_time}`

Returns the tickets that changed since the start time. For more information, see [Exporting tickets](/documentation/ticketing/managing-tickets/using-the-incremental-export-api#exporting-tickets)
in [Using the Incremental Exports API](/documentation/ticketing/managing-tickets/using-the-incremental-export-api)
.

This endpoint supports cursor-based incremental exports. Cursor-based exports are highly encouraged because they provide more consistent performance and response body sizes. For more information, see [Cursor-based incremental exports](/documentation/ticketing/managing-tickets/using-the-incremental-export-api#cursor-based-incremental-exports)
in [Using the Incremental Exports API](/documentation/ticketing/managing-tickets/using-the-incremental-export-api)

### [](#incremental-ticket-export-time-based) Incremental Ticket Export, Time Based

- `GET /api/v2/incremental/tickets?start_time={start_time}`

Returns the tickets that changed since the start time. For more information, see [Exporting tickets](/documentation/ticketing/managing-tickets/using-the-incremental-export-api#exporting-tickets)
in [Using the Incremental Exports API](/documentation/ticketing/managing-tickets/using-the-incremental-export-api)
.

This endpoint supports time-based incremental exports. For more information, see [Time-based incremental exports](/documentation/ticketing/managing-tickets/using-the-incremental-export-api#time-based-incremental-exports)
in [Using the Incremental Exports API](/documentation/ticketing/managing-tickets/using-the-incremental-export-api)
. You can also return tickets using cursor-based pagination. See [Incremental Ticket Export, Cursor Based](#incremental-ticket-export-cursor-based)
.

The results include tickets that were updated by the system. See [Excluding system-updated tickets](/documentation/ticketing/managing-tickets/using-the-incremental-export-api#excluding-system-updated-tickets-time-based-exports)
in [Using the Incremental Exports API](/documentation/ticketing/managing-tickets/using-the-incremental-export-api)
.

The endpoint can return tickets with an `updated_at` time that's earlier than the `start_time` time. The reason is that the API compares the `start_time` with the ticket's `generated_timestamp` value, not its `updated_at` value. The `updated_at` value is updated only if the update generates a [ticket event](#incremental-ticket-event-export)
. The `generated_timestamp` value is updated for all ticket updates, including system updates. If a system update occurs after a ticket event, the unchanged `updated_at` time will become earlier relative to the updated `generated_timestamp` time.

### [](#incremental-ticket-event-export) Incremental Ticket Event Export

- `GET /api/v2/incremental/ticket_events?start_time={start_time}`

Returns a stream of changes that occurred on tickets, excluding events occuring within one minute of the request. Each event is tied to an update on a ticket and contains all the fields that were updated in that change. For more information, see:

- [Exporting ticket events](/documentation/ticketing/managing-tickets/using-the-incremental-export-api#exporting-ticket-events)
  in [Using the Incremental Exports API](/documentation/ticketing/managing-tickets/using-the-incremental-export-api)

  in [Using the Incremental Exports API](/documentation/ticketing/managing-tickets/using-the-incremental-export-api)

You can include comments in the event stream by using the `comment_events` sideload. See Sideloading below. If you don't specify the sideload, any comment present in the ticket update is described only by Boolean `comment_present` and `comment_public` object properties in the event's `child_events` array. The comment itself is not included.

#### [](#allowed-for-2) Allowed For

#### [](#limits) Limits

This endpoint has its own rate limit that is different from the account wide rate limit. When calls are made to this endpoint, this limit will be consumed and you will get a `429 Too Many Requests` response code if the allocation is exhausted.

##### [](#headers) Headers

API responses include usage limit information in the headers for this endpoint.

Within this header, “Total” signifies the initial allocation, “Remaining” indicates the remaining allowance for the current interval, and “Resets” denotes the wait time in seconds before the limit refreshes. You can see the Total, and Interval values in the below table.

##### [](#details) Details

This is the limit definition for the List Tags endpoint.

| Rate Limits                 | Scopes  | Interval | Sandbox | Trial | Default |

- `GET /api/v2/tags/count`

Returns an approximate count of tags. If the count exceeds 100,000, it is updated every 24 hours.

The `refreshed_at` property of the `count` object is a timestamp that indicates when the count was last updated.

**Note**: When the count exceeds 100,000, the `refreshed_at` property in the `count` object may occasionally be null. This indicates that the count is being updated in the background and the `value` property in the `count` object is limited to 100,000 until the update is complete.

You can also add tags to multiple tickets with the [Update Many Tickets](/api-reference/ticketing/tickets/tickets/#update-many-tickets)
endpoint.

#### [](#safe-update) Safe Update

If the same ticket is updated by multiple API requests at the same time, some tags could be lost because of ticket update collisions. Include `updated_stamp` and `safe_update` properties in the request body to make a safe update.

For `updated_stamp`, retrieve and specify the ticket's latest `updated_at` timestamp. The tag update only occurs if the `updated_stamp` timestamp matches the ticket's actual `updated_at` timestamp at the time of the request. If the timestamps don't match (in other words, if the ticket was updated since you retrieved the ticket's last `updated_at` timestamp), the request returns a 409 Conflict error.

**Note**: The endpoints listed on this page are for the [legacy CSAT feature](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408822875034)
. We recommend you use survey responses for more accurate and relevant feedback. For more information, see [Survey responses](/api-reference/help_center/help-center-api/survey_responses/)
, [Survey offered event](/documentation/ticketing/reference-guides/ticket-audit-events-reference/#survey-offered-event)
, and [Survey response submitted event](/documentation/ticketing/reference-guides/ticket-audit-events-reference/#survey-response-submitted-event)
. See also [Setting up the CSAT survey](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/7689997846554)
. If you are using the legacy CSAT, you must [deactivate legacy CSAT and manually deactivate any custom CSAT automations and triggers](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408822875034#topic_lgj_cmr_w1c)
before you can use survey responses. You can have only one CSAT option activated at a time.

If you have enabled satisfaction ratings for your account, this endpoint allows you to quickly retrieve all ratings.

It supports cursor pagination and offset pagination when paginating through results. See [Pagination](/api-reference/introduction/pagination/)

### [](#count-satisfaction-ratings) Count Satisfaction Ratings

- `GET /api/v2/satisfaction_ratings/count`

Returns an approximate count of satisfaction ratings in the account. If the count exceeds 100,000, the count will return a cached result. This cached result will update every 24 hours.

The `count[refreshed_at]` property is a timestamp that indicates when the count was last updated.

**Note**: When the count exceeds 100,000, `count[refreshed_at]` may occasionally be null. This indicates that the count is being updated in the background, and `count[value]` is limited to 100,000 until the update is complete.

================================================
**Note**: The endpoints listed on this page are for the [legacy CSAT feature](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408822875034)
. We recommend you use survey responses for more accurate and relevant feedback. For more information, see [Survey responses](/api-reference/help_center/help-center-api/survey_responses/)
, [Survey offered event](/documentation/ticketing/reference-guides/ticket-audit-events-reference/#survey-offered-event)
, and [Survey response submitted event](/documentation/ticketing/reference-guides/ticket-audit-events-reference/#survey-response-submitted-event)
. See also [Setting up the CSAT survey](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/7689997846554)
. If you are using the legacy CSAT, you must [deactivate legacy CSAT and manually deactivate any custom CSAT automations and triggers](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408822875034#topic_lgj_cmr_w1c)
before you can use survey responses. You can have only one CSAT option activated at a time.

When [satisfaction reasons](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/223152967)
are enabled in your Zendesk Support account, and a user gives a negative rating to a solved ticket, a follow-up question is presented to the user. The question includes a list menu of possible reasons for the negative rating. You can use this API to inspect the list of reasons.

You must use the admin interface to add or remove reasons. See [Customizing and localizing satisfaction reasons](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/223152967#topic_u2m_c4b_rw)
in the Support Help Center.

# https://developer.zendesk.com/api-reference/ticketing/ticket-management/dynamic_content/ - Dynamic Content Items | Zendesk Developer Docszendev_horizontalzendev_horizontal with metadata date undefined

================================================
Dynamic content is a combination of a default version of some text and variants of the text in other languages. The combined content is represented by a placeholder such as {{dc.my_placeholder}}. Dynamic content is available only on the Professional plan and above. [Learn more](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203663356)
in the Support Help Center.

This page contains the API reference for dynamic content items. See [Dynamic Content Item Variants](/api-reference/ticketing/ticket-management/dynamic_content_item_variants/)
for the reference for variants.

You can use dynamic content with the API to set some properties of [ticket fields](/api-reference/ticketing/tickets/ticket_fields/)
, [ticket forms](/api-reference/ticketing/tickets/ticket_forms/)
, [user fields](/api-reference/ticketing/users/user_fields/)
, and [organization fields](/api-reference/ticketing/organizations/organization_fields/)
. For example, you can use dynamic content for the title of a ticket field. In that case, use the dynamic content placeholder for the value of the field's `raw_title` property and the the default version of the text as the value of the `title` property. Example:

`"title": "Flight Number", "raw_title": "{{dc.my_field_title}}", ...`

If dynamic content is not used for the property, the two values are identical:

`"title": "Flight Number", "raw_title": "Flight Number", ...`

### [](#data-hierarchy) Data hierarchy

The data structure for dynamic content is a parent-child hierarchy where variants belong to items.

- **Items**

  These are the dynamic content placeholders defined by content creators. Each item defines a namespace for a specific piece of content, such as instructions on how to reset your password or upgrade your plan. An item's only content is the title of the item itself (defined by you) and a placeholder for that item (defined by Zendesk Support). The content itself is contained in the variants.

- **Variants**

  These are pieces of locale-specific content, where the context is based on the item they belong to. You can only have one variant per locale, per item. For example, if an item has 3 variants, they must each have a unique locale such as English, Spanish and French. They can't be English, English, and Spanish (though it is possible to have English-US and English-UK).

Each item has a unique ID and a unique dynamic content placeholder. Below each item are a number of variants, all with their unique ID and locale. Items can contain any number of variants.

### [](#paginating-and-sorting) Paginating and sorting

This API uses standard pagination and sorting parameters. See [Pagination](/api-reference/introduction/pagination/)
.

You can sort the results of any list endpoint (both asc and desc) by the following properties: `locale`, `outdated`, `active`, `updated_at`, and `created_at`. The default sorting is by `id` in descending order.

### [](#specifying-item-variants) Specifying item variants

When [creating](#create-item)
or [updating](#update-item)
an item, specify the variants in the item's `variants` array. Each variant consists of a `locale_id`, `default`, and `content` property. See [Dynamic Content Item Variants](/api-reference/ticketing/ticket-management/dynamic_content_item_variants/)
for the variants API reference.

Zendesk Support uses the `default` variant if it can't find a variant that matches the user's locale.

Example, formatted for clarity:

If you have only one variant, you can use the `content` property instead of the `variants` property:

However, we recommend passing an array of variants even if you only have one variant.

### [](#json-format) JSON format

Dynamic Content Items are represented as JSON objects with the following properties:

| Name              | Type    | Read-only | Mandatory | Description                                                                                                                                                  |

# https://developer.zendesk.com/api-reference/ticketing/ticket-management/dynamic_content_item_variants/ - Dynamic Content Item Variants | Zendesk Developer Docszendev_horizontalzendev_horizontal with metadata date undefined

================================================
Dynamic content item variants are locale-specific versions of a dynamic content item. To learn more, see [Dynamic Content Items](/api-reference/ticketing/ticket-management/dynamic_content/)
.

### [](#json-format) JSON format

Dynamic Content Item Variants are represented as JSON objects with the following properties:

| Name       | Type    | Read-only | Mandatory | Description                                              |
| ---------- | ------- | --------- | --------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| active     | boolean | false     | false     | If the variant is active and useable                     |
| content    | string  | false     | true      | The content of the variant                               |
| created_at | string  | true      | false     | When the variant was created                             |
| default    | boolean | false     | false     | If the variant is the default for the item it belongs to |
| id         | integer | true      | false     | Automatically assigned when the variant is created       |
| locale_id  | integer | false     | true      | An active locale                                         |
| outdated   | boolean | true      | false     | If the variant is outdated                               |
| updated_at | string  | true      | false     | When the variant was last updated                        |
| url        | string  | true      | false     | The API url of the variant                               |

A few items are worth noting:

- `locale_id` - Must be an active locale in the account. To get a list, see [/api/v2/locales](/api-reference/ticketing/account-configuration/locales/#list-locales)
- `default` - Used as the fallback if Zendesk Support can't find an appropriate variant to match the locale of the user the content is being displayed for
- `outdated`- Indicates the default variant for this item has been updated, but the other variants were not changed. The content may be out of date
- `active` - If false, Zendesk Support will not use the variant even if the user's locale matches the variant

# https://developer.zendesk.com/api-reference/ticketing/ticket-management/incremental_skill_based_routing/ - Incremental Skill-based Routing | Zendesk Developer Docszendev_horizontalzendev_horizontal with metadata date undefined

================================================
You can use the Incremental Skill-based Routing API to export data on the creation, update, and deletion of skill types, skills, and instance values. To learn more about the feature, see [Using skills-based routing](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000789788)
in the Support Help Center.

In this API, skill types are named _attributes_ and skills are named _attribute values_.

Skill-based routing is only available on the Enterprise plan and above.

### [](#json-format) JSON Format

The exported items are represented as JSON objects. The format depends on the exported resource, but all have the following additional common attributes:

| Name      | Type    | Comment                                                                              |
| --------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| end_time  | integer | The most recent resource creation time present in this result set in Unix epoch time |
| next_page | string  | The URL that should be called to get the next set of results                         |
| count     | integer | The number of results returned for the current request                               |

For complete lists of attributes, see the JSON format sections below.

### [](#pagination) Pagination

The endpoints of the skill-based routing API return a maximum of 3000 records per page.

When the response exceeds the per-page maximum, you can paginate to the next page via the `next_page` URL in the response body:

Stop paging when the `count` attribute is 0.

The pagination for skill-based incremental export endpoints works slightly differently from other endpoints. The `per_page` parameter doesn't apply because of the time-based way these endpoints return records. The `limit` parameter doesn't apply because of the way a single record can generate multiple events.

Unlike other endpoints, skill-based incremental export endpoints uses cursor-based pagination. The `cursor` parameter is a non-human-readable argument you can use to move forward or backward in time. The cursor is a read-only URL parameter that's only available in API responses.

### [](#json-format-for-routing-attributes) JSON Format for Routing Attributes

A routing attribute is a skill type. Routing attributes have the following format:

| Name | Type   | Comment                                                 |
| ---- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| id   | string | Automatically assigned when an attribute is created     |
| name | string | The name of the attribute                               |
| time | date   | The time the attribute was created, updated, or deleted |
| type | string | One of "create", "update", or "delete"                  |

#### [](#example) Example

### [](#json-format-for-routing-attribute-values) JSON Format for Routing Attribute Values

A routing attribute value is a skill. Routing attribute values have the following format:

| Name         | Type   | Comment                                                       |
| ------------ | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| id           | string | Automatically assigned when an attribute value is created     |
| attribute_id | string | Id of the associated attribute                                |
| name         | string | The name of the attribute value                               |
| time         | date   | The time the attribute value was created, updated, or deleted |
| type         | string | One of "create", "update", or "delete"                        |

#### [](#example-1) Example

### [](#json-format-for-routing-instance-values) JSON Format for Routing Instance Values

Routing instance values have the following format:

| ------------------ | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| id                 | string | Automatically assigned when an instance value is created                                   |
| attribute_value_id | string | Id of the associated attribute value                                                       |
| instance_id        | string | Id of the associated agent or ticket                                                       |
| time               | date   | The time the instance value was created or deleted                                         |
| type               | string | One of "associate_agent", "unassociate_agent", "associate_ticket", or "unassociate_ticket" |

# https://developer.zendesk.com/api-reference/ticketing/ticket-management/resource_collections/ - Resource Collections | Zendesk Developer Docszendev_horizontalzendev_horizontal with metadata date undefined

================================================
A resource collection consists of Zendesk Support resource definitions. For example, a resource collection could define two different targets and one ticket field. You specify the resource collection the same way you specify the [resource requirements](/documentation/apps/app-developer-guide/apps_requirements/)
for a Zendesk app.

#### [](#resource-objects) Resource objects

The [List Resource Collections](/api-reference/ticketing/ticket-management/resource_collections/#list-resource-collections)
and [Show Resource Collection](/api-reference/ticketing/ticket-management/resource_collections/#show-resource-collection)
endpoints return a `resources` array. Each object in the `resources` array contains metadata for a resource in a resource collection.

Objects in the `resources` array have the following properties:

| Name        | Type    | Read-only | Mandatory | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ----------- | ------- | --------- | --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| identifier  | string  | true      | false     | Descriptive name for the resource                                                                                                                                                                          |
| resource_id | integer | true      | false     | Unique id for the resource. Automatically assigned upon creation                                                                                                                                           |
| type        | array   | true      | false     | Resource type. Possible values are "automations", "channel_integrations", "custom_objects", "macros", "organization_fields", "targets", "ticket_fields", "triggers", "user_fields", "view", and "webhooks" |
| deleted     | boolean | true      | false     | If true, the resource has been deleted                                                                                                                                                                     |

### [](#json-format) JSON format

| Name       | Type    | Read-only | Mandatory | Description                                                                   |

| created_at | string  | true      | false     | When the resource collection was created                                      |
| id         | integer | true      | false     | id for the resource collection. Automatically assigned upon creation          |
| resources  | array   | true      | false     | Array of resource metadata objects. See [Resource objects](#resource-objects) |

#### [](#intervals) Intervals

An interval represents a period of business hours. Intervals are writable only when [updating intervals for a schedule](/api-reference/ticketing/ticket-management/schedules/#update-intervals-for-a-schedule)
. Otherwise, intervals are read-only.

Intervals are represented with the following attributes:

| Name       | Type    | Comment                                                                                                       |
| ---------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| start_time | integer | Integer representation of the interval start time in minutes since Sunday at midnight                         |
| end_time   | integer | Integer representation of the interval end time in minutes since Sunday at midnight. Can't span calendar days |

The `start_time` and `end_time` values are expressed as the number of minutes since the start of the week, which is defined as Sunday at midnight. Intervals can't span calendar days.

For example, an interval might start on Monday at 9:00 a.m. and end at 17:00 (5 p.m.).

If you have multiple shifts per day, an interval might start on Tuesday at 16:00 (4 p.m.) and end at 00:00 (midnight). Intervals can't span calendar days, so must end at midnight at the latest. To avoid gaps in business hours, you can use midnight as the end time for an interval and the start time for the following interval.

To calculate the start and end times, use the equation: ((hours since Sunday at midnight)\*60) + (minutes of incomplete hour). To help you more easily determine your start and end times, the following table lists the minutes since Sunday at midnight at 12-hour increments throughout the week.

| Week time          | Minute time |
| ------------------ | ----------- |
| Sunday midnight    | 0, 10080    |
| Sunday noon        | 720         |
| Monday midnight    | 1440        |
| Monday noon        | 2160        |
| Tuesday midnight   | 2880        |
| Tuesday noon       | 3600        |
| Wednesday midnight | 4320        |
| Wednesday noon     | 5040        |
| Thursday midnight  | 5760        |
| Thursday noon      | 6480        |
| Friday midnight    | 7200        |
| Friday noon        | 7920        |
| Saturday midnight  | 8640        |
| Saturday noon      | 9360        |

The end of the week is defined as Saturday at 23:59 (11:59 pm). In minutes since Sunday at midnight, this is 10079. The API accepts a value of `0` or `10080` to represent midnight between Saturday and Sunday.

#### [](#holidays) Holidays

Holidays are represented with the following attributes:

| Name       | Type    | Comment                                           |
| ---------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| id         | integer | Automatically assigned upon creation              |
| name       | string  | Name of the holiday                               |
| start_date | string  | ISO 8601 representation of the holiday start date |
| end_date   | string  | ISO 8601 representation of the holiday end date   |

Holidays can be a single day or multiple days in length.

# https://developer.zendesk.com/api-reference/ticketing/business-rules/sla_policies/ - SLA Policies | Zendesk Developer Docszendev_horizontalzendev_horizontal with metadata date undefined

================================================
A Service Level Agreement is a documented agreement between a support provider and their customers that specifies performance measures for support. SLAs are often expressed as follows:

_For urgent incidents, we will respond to tickets in 10 minutes and resolve the ticket within 2 hours.\*\*For high priority incidents, we will respond to tickets in 30 minutes and resolved the ticket within 8 hours._

Because there may be different SLAs per customer (or group of customers) that the provider supports, the provider will define an SLA policy to support each unique SLA's requirements.

A SLA policy is the unique (not enforced) combination of criteria along with assigned metric targets for each value of the priority field. There can be multiple SLA policies per Zendesk Support account.

### [](#json-format) JSON format

#### [](#filter) Filter

A filter checks the value of ticket fields and selects the ticket if the conditions are met. Filter is represented as a JSON object with two arrays of one or more conditions.

**Example**

The first array lists all the conditions that must be met. The second array lists any condition that must be met.

| Name  | Type  | Description                                                                       |
| ----- | ----- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `all` | array | Logical AND. Tickets must fulfill all of the conditions to be considered matching |
| `any` | array | Logical OR. Tickets may satisfy any of the conditions to be considered matching   |

Each condition in an array has the following properties:

| Name     | Type   | Description                 |
| -------- | ------ | --------------------------- |
| field    | string | The name of a ticket field  |
| operator | string | A comparison operator       |
| value    | string | The value of a ticket field |

**Example**

See [Conditions reference](/documentation/ticketing/reference-guides/conditions-reference)
for the list of fields, allowed operators, and values of the conditions.

#### [](#policy-metric) Policy Metric

An object that describes the metric targets for each value of the priority field.

Policy Metrics are represented as simple flat JSON objects which have the following keys:

| Name              | Type    | Comment                                                                                   |
| ----------------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| priority          | string  | Priority that a ticket must match                                                         |
| metric            | string  | The definition of the time that is being measured. See [Metrics](#metrics)                |
| target            | integer | The total time within which the end-state for a metric should be met, measured in minutes |
| target_in_seconds | integer | The total time within which the end-state for a metric should be met, measured in seconds |
| business_hours    | boolean | Whether the metric targets are being measured in business hours or calendar hours         |

**Example**

#### [](#metrics) Metrics

| Metric                | Value                 |
| --------------------- | --------------------- |
| Agent Work Time       | agent_work_time       |

# https://developer.zendesk.com/api-reference/ticketing/ticket-management/skill_based_routing/ - Skill-based Routing | Zendesk Developer Docszendev_horizontalzendev_horizontal with metadata date undefined

================================================
You can use the skill-based routing API to list skill types and skills, as well as list and set skills for tickets and agents. To learn more about the feature, see [Using skills-based routing](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000789788)
in the Support Help Center.

In this API, skill types are named _attributes_ and skills are named _attribute values_.

Skill-based routing is only available on the Enterprise plan and above.

#### [](#attribute) Attribute

An _attribute_ in this API refers to a skill type. Skill types are categories of skills.

| Name | Type   | Comment                                             |
| ---- | ------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| id   | string | Automatically assigned when an attribute is created |
| name | string | The name of the attribute                           |

#### [](#attribute-values) Attribute Values

An _attribute value_ in this API refers to a skill. Skills are associated with an agent and determine the agent's suitability to solve a ticket.

| Name         | Type   | Comment                                                   |
| ------------ | ------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| id           | string | Automatically assigned when an attribute value is created |
| name         | string | The name of the attribute value                           |
| attribute_id | string | Id of the associated attribute                            |

### [](#json-format) JSON format

Skill Based Routing are represented as JSON objects with the following properties:

| Name       | Type   | Read-only | Mandatory | Description                                         |

# https://developer.zendesk.com/api-reference/ticketing/business-rules/automations/ - Automations | Zendesk Developer Docszendev_horizontalzendev_horizontal with metadata date undefined

================================================
An automation consists of one or more actions that are performed if certain conditions are met after a period of time. The conditions are checked every hour. For example, an automation can notify an agent when a ticket remains unresolved after 24 hours.

Even if the actions are performed once, they'll be performed again later if the conditions still apply. To ensure the actions are performed only once, include an action in the automation that cancels one of the conditions.

For more information, see [Creating and managing automations for time-based events](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203662126)
.

================================================
A view consists of one or more conditions that define a collection of tickets to display. If the conditions are met, the ticket is included in the view. For example, a view can display all open tickets that were last updated more than 24 hours ago.

For more information, see [Creating views to manage ticket workflow](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408888828570)

If `type` is "Group", the `ids` property is the preferred method of specifying the group id or ids.

#### [](#example-request-body) Example Request Body

#### [](#view-columns) View columns

The `output` request parameter lets you specify what columns to include in the view in the agent interface. Example: `"output": {"columns": ["status", "description", "priority"]}`. The following table lists possible columns for views in the agent UI and the corresponding values in the `columns` array.

For custom fields, specify the id of the custom field in the `columns` array.

You can specify a total of 10 columns to a view.

### [](#execute-view) Execute View

- `GET /api/v2/views/{view_id}/execute`

Returns the column titles and the rows of the specified view.

The `columns` array lists the view's column titles and includes only views parameters.

The `rows` array lists the values of each column for each ticket and includes parameters from both views and tickets. Though not displayed in the view, a partial ticket object is included with each row object.

**Note**: To get the full ticket objects for a specified view, use [List Tickets from a View](#list-tickets-from-a-view)
.

This endpoint is rate limited to 5 requests per minute, per view, per agent. This rate limit includes activity in Zendesk Support. An API script is more likely to encounter rate limit errors if the authenticating agent or admin is concurrently active in Zendesk Support.

The view execution system is designed for periodic rather than high-frequency API usage. In particular, views called very frequently may be cached by Zendesk. This means that the API client will still receive a result, but that result may have been computed at any time within the last 10 minutes.

Zendesk recommends using the Incremental Ticket Export endpoint to get the latest changes. You can call it more often, and it returns all the tickets that changed since the last poll. For details and rate limits, see [Incremental Exports](/api-reference/ticketing/ticket-management/incremental_exports/)
.

View output sorting can be controlled by passing the `sort_by` and `sort_order` parameters in the format described in the table in [Preview Views](#preview-views)
.

### [](#count-tickets-in-view) Count Tickets in View

- `GET /api/v2/views/{view_id}/count`

Returns the ticket count for a single view.

This endpoint is rate limited to 5 requests per minute, per view, per agent.

#### [](#view-counts) View Counts

The view count endpoints, Count Tickets in View (this endpoint) and [Count Tickets in Views](#count-tickets-in-views)
, let you estimate how many tickets remain in a view without having to retrieve the entire view. They're designed to help estimate view size. From a business perspective, accuracy becomes less relevant as view size increases.

To ensure quality of service, these counts are cached more heavily as the number of tickets in a view grows. For a view with thousands of tickets, you can expect the count to be cached for 60-90 minutes. As a result, the count may not reflect the actual number of tickets in your view.

View counts are represented as JSON objects with the following attributes:

| Name    | Type    | Comment                                                                                                                                     |

================================================

# https://developer.zendesk.com/api-reference/ticketing/business-rules/triggers/ - Triggers | Zendesk Developer Docszendev_horizontalzendev_horizontal with metadata date undefined

================================================
A ticket trigger consists of one or more actions performed when a ticket is created or updated. The actions are performed only if certain conditions are met. For example, a ticket trigger can notify the customer when an agent changes the status of a ticket to Solved.

Ticket triggers also may depend on one or more conditions being met.

For more information on conditions and actions, see the following Help Center articles:

- [Support API: Conditions reference](/documentation/ticketing/reference-guides/conditions-reference)
- [Support API: Actions reference](/documentation/ticketing/reference-guides/actions-reference)

All your ticket triggers are checked from first to last each time a ticket is created or updated. The order of ticket triggers is important because the actions of one ticket trigger may affect another trigger. New ticket triggers are added in last place by default.

For more information, see [Creating ticket triggers for automatic ticket updates and notifications](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408886797466)
.

**Note**: This endpoints described on this page apply only to ticket triggers. For object trigger API documentation, see [Object Triggers](/api-reference/ticketing/business-rules/object_triggers)

#### [](#pagination-3) Pagination

This endpoint uses cursor-based pagination. The records are ordered in descending order by the `created_at` timestamp, then by `id` on duplicate `created_at` values.

The `cursor` parameter is a non-human-readable argument you can use to move forward or backward in time.

Each JSON response will contain the following attributes to help you get more results:

- `after_url` requests more recent results
- `before_url` requests older results
- `after_cursor` is the cursor to build the request yourself
- `before_cursor` is the cursor to build the request yourself

The properties are null if no more records are available.

You can request a maximum of 1000 records using the `limit` parameter. If no `limit` parameter is supplied, it will default to 1,000.

# https://developer.zendesk.com/api-reference/ticketing/business-rules/group_sla_policies/ - Group SLA Policies | Zendesk Developer Docszendev_horizontalzendev_horizontal with metadata date undefined

================================================
A Group Service Level Agreement (SLA) is a documented agreement between a support provider and their customers that specifies support performance measures for a group of agents. Group SLAs are often expressed as follows:

*For urgent incidents, the tier 1 group solves or reassigns the ticket to another group within 10 minutes. *For high-priority incidents, the tier 3 group solves or reassign the ticket to another group the ticket within 30 minutes.

Because there may be different Group SLAs for each customer or group of customers, the support provider should define a Group SLA policy for each unique Group SLA's requirements.

All related endpoints are available on the Enterprise plans and above. Only admins are allowed to access the endpoints.

### [](#json-format) JSON format

Group SLA Policies are represented as JSON objects with the following properties:

================================================
A macro consists of one or more actions that modify the values of a ticket's fields. Macros are applied to tickets manually by agents. For example, you can create macros for support requests that agents can answer with a single, standard response. For more information, see [Using macros to update and add comments to tickets](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408887656602)
.

### [](#json-format) JSON format

Macros are represented as JSON objects with the following properties:

# https://developer.zendesk.com/api-reference/ticketing/account-configuration/support_addresses/ - Support Addresses | Zendesk Developer Docszendev_horizontalzendev_horizontal with metadata date undefined

================================================
When you set up Zendesk Support, you have one email address: [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#275452575748555367425f464a574b42095d42494342544c0944484a)
. Emails received at this address become tickets.

You can provide your users with additional email addresses for submitting tickets. The additional addresses are called support addresses. You can add up to 3000 support addresses. They can be Zendesk addresses or external addresses. If adding external addresses, additional steps are required to set up forwarding from your email server to your Zendesk account.

Support addresses allow you to customize the "sender" address for your outgoing notifications. When an email is received at a support address, Zendesk responds from the same address. For example, if an email is sent to [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#046c61687444617c65697468612a7e616a6061776f2a676b69)
, Zendesk sends a notification from [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#0e666b627e4e6b766f637e626b20746b606a6b7d65206d6163)
.

For more information, see [Adding support addresses for users to submit tickets](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203663336)
.

### [](#create-support-address) Create Support Address

- `POST /api/v2/recipient_addresses`

Adds a Zendesk or external support address to your account.

To add a Zendesk address, use the following syntax: `{local-part}@{accountname}.zendesk.com`. Example: '[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#83f0e2efe6f0aef7e6e2eec3e6fbe2eef3efe6adf9e6ede7e6f0e8ade0ecee)
'. The [local-part](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_address#Local-part)
can be anything you like.

To add an external email address such as [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#deb6bbb2ae9eb1b3b0b7a9bbbfacadb6b1aef0bdb1b3)
, the email must already exist and you must set up forwarding on your email server. The exact steps depend on your mail server. See [Forwarding incoming email to Zendesk Support](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203663266)
. After setting up forwarding, run the [Verify Support Address Forwarding](#verify-support-address-forwarding)
endpoint. The address won't work in Zendesk Support until it's been verified.

### [](#verify-support-address-forwarding) Verify Support Address Forwarding

- `PUT /api/v2/recipient_addresses/{support_address_id}/verify`

Sends a test email to the specified support address to verify that email forwarding for the address works. An external support address won't work in Zendesk Support until it's verified.

**Note**: You don't need to verify Zendesk system support addresses.

The endpoint takes the following body: `{"type": "forwarding"}`. The value of the `type` property defaults to "forwarding" if none is specified, but the values "spf" and "dns" are also accepted.

Use this endpoint after [adding](#create-support-address)
an external support address to Zendesk Support and setting up forwarding on your email server. See [Forwarding incoming email to Zendesk Support](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203663266)
.

The endpoint doesn't return the results of the test. Instead, use the [Show Support Address](#show-support-address)
endpoint to check that the `forwarding_status` property is "verified".

Other verification checks can also be performed using this API. These include SPF checks and DNS checks.

When calling the endpoint with `type` set to "spf", it will queries the DNS records to check that the SPF records for Zendesk are present for outbound emails.

When calling the endpoint with `type` set to "dns", it runs checks on your CNAME records to make sure they are set up properly in your DNS.

# https://developer.zendesk.com/api-reference/ticketing/account-configuration/sessions/ - Sessions | Zendesk Developer Docszendev_horizontalzendev_horizontal with metadata date undefined

================================================
When an administrator, agent, or end user signs in to a Zendesk Support instance, a `session` is created. The Sessions API lets you view who is currently signed in. It also lets you terminate one or more sessions. Terminating a session signs out the user.

### [](#json-format) JSON format

Sessions are represented as JSON objects with the following properties:

| Name             | Type    | Read-only | Mandatory | Description                                                                             |

# https://developer.zendesk.com/api-reference/ticketing/account-configuration/access_logs/ - Access Logs | Zendesk Developer Docszendev_horizontalzendev_horizontal with metadata date undefined

================================================
The access log is a 90-day record of events that captures what an agent or admin has accessed in your account without necessarily updating, creating, or deleting anything. The access log is your record of read and write events for your account.

The [Advanced Data Privacy and Protection (ADPP)](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/6119316155930)
add-on is required to use this API.

The Access Logs API can return two kinds of identifiers for the resources accessed: a REST API path or a GraphQL query. The log also provides additional information, including:

- timestamp
- query parameters
- the HTTP method used, such as GET or POST
- the user id of the user who made the request
- the IP address of the user who made the request
- the authorization type (currently not supported for GraphQL requests)
- the client. A characteristic string that lets servers and network peers identify the application, operating system, vendor, and version of the requesting [user agent](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/User_agent)

You can filter the access logs based on when the event happened, or based on objects or users within a specified time frame. The examples below show all filters, but that's not required. You can specify as many filters as needed.

**Filtering by objects**

`filter[start]`: UTC time stamp in the format of yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ssZ

`filter[end]`: UTC time stamp in the format of yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ssZ

`filter[path]`: URL path of the object, excluding query parameters

Example:

**Filtering by users**

`filter[start]`: UTC time stamp in the format of yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ssZ

`filter[end]`: UTC time stamp in the format of yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ssZ

`filter[user_id]`: User id

Example:

**Filtering by time stamps**

`filter[start]`: UTC time stamp in the format of yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ssZ

filter[end]`: UTC time stamp in the format of yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ssZ

#### [](#fields-array) fields array

The `fields` array lists ticket fields to set in Zendesk and their values. Each item consists of a field identifier (`id`) and a value (`value`) for the field. For Zendesk system fields such as `subject`, the identifier is the English name. For custom fields, the identifier may be a field ID or a name. See [Ticket Fields](/api-reference/ticketing/tickets/ticket_fields/)
.

The `fields` array can only set ticket values on ticket creation, not on ticket updates.

#### [](#response-format) Response format

The response is a JSON object containing a single key:

| Name    | Type  | Comments                                     |
| ------- | ----- | -------------------------------------------- |
| results | array | An array of [result objects](#result-object) |

The `results` array contains an entry for each item in the incoming `external_resources` array, in the same order. For example, if you call `push` with 3 external resources, a successful response will include `results` with three entries, corresponding to your 3 resources.

#### [](#result-object) result object

# https://developer.zendesk.com/api-reference/ticketing/account-configuration/public_ips/ - Zendesk Public IPs | Zendesk Developer Docszendev_horizontalzendev_horizontal with metadata date undefined

================================================
This API retrieves a list of Zendesk’s main public IP ingress and egress addresses. For additional configuration for specific products, see [Configuring your firewall for use with Zendesk](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203660846-Configuring-your-firewall-for-use-with-Zendesk)
in Help Center.

### [](#json-format) JSON format

Public IPs are represented as JSON objects with the following properties:

| Name    | Type   | Read-only | Mandatory | Description                                                                                 |
| ------- | ------ | --------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| egress  | object | true      | false     | The list of IPs Zendesk will connect to your systems. [See IP List Object](#ip-list-object) |
| ingress | object | true      | false     | The list of IPs you use to connect to Zendesk. [See IP List Object](#ip-list-object)        |

#### [](#ip-list-object) IP List Object

| Name     | Type  | Description              |
| -------- | ----- | ------------------------ |
| all      | array | The full list of IPs     |
| specific | array | The specific list of IPs |

A temporary key (`specific`) is also available in case your firewall can't configure all the IPs. If you use it, make sure your script expects that `specific` might disappear and reads from `all` in that case. If your account is moved to another Pod, the specific list will change and your firewall will block the unknown IPs.

You can set up an alert or integration using this endpoint.

#### [](#example) Example

### [](#list-zendesk-public-ips) List Zendesk Public IPs

- `GET /ips`

Retrieves a list of Zendesk’s main public IP ingress and egress addresses.

As a best practice, set up a scheduled request (such as daily) to alert if the list changes, or to configure your firewall. This also helps Zendesk identify the customers that use this feature. Zendesk can reach out if it needs to execute emergency IP changes.

# https://developer.zendesk.com/api-reference/ticketing/oauth/grant_type_tokens/ - OAuth Tokens for Grant Types | Zendesk Developer Docszendev_horizontalzendev_horizontal with metadata date undefined

================================================
This API includes the [Create Token for Grant Type](#create-token-for-grant-type)
endpoint which allows you to obtain access tokens for both the authorization code and the refresh token grant types.

For more information, see [Authorization code grant flow](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408845965210#topic_jkc_dcm_dcc)
and [Refresh token grant flow](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408845965210)
in Zendesk help.

If you're not working with grant types, use the [Create Token](/api-reference/ticketing/oauth/oauth_tokens#create-token)
endpoint in the OAuth Tokens API. The two APIs don't share the same path, JSON format, or request parameters. However, both APIs return access tokens that can be used to [authenticate API requests](/api-reference/ticketing/introduction/#oauth-access-token)
.

### [](#authorization-code-grant-type) Authorization code grant type

The authorization code grant flow enables an application to obtain an access token on behalf of a user after the user successfully authenticates and grants permission. To initiate this flow, redirect the user to the authorization server's authorization endpoint, where they log in and authorize the application. After successful authorization, the server redirects the user back to the specified redirect URI with an `authorization_code`. The application then exchanges this authorization code for an access token by sending a request to the `/oauth/tokens` endpoint, including the `authorization_code`, `client_id`, and, if using PKCE, the `code_verifier`. This access token allows the application to access protected resources on behalf of the user. When using PKCE, the initial authorization request must also include the `code_challenge` and `code_challenge_method` parameters.

### [](#refresh-token-grant-type) Refresh token grant type

The refresh token grant type allows for refreshing an access token that has either expired or is about to expire. To generate a new OAuth access token, pass a `refresh_token` parameter to the `/oauth/tokens` endpoint using `grant_type: refresh_token`. This process returns a new access token and refresh token while invalidating the previous access and refresh tokens. Refresh tokens will be issued for all new OAuth token requests, but existing OAuth tokens cannot be refreshed.

The `authorization_code` and `refresh_token` grant types accept the `expires_in` and `refresh_token_expires_in` parameters in requests to the `/oauth/tokens` endpoint, allowing clients to set expiration times.

There is no default `expires_in` value to preserve current access token behavior. However, you can specify an `expires_in` value through the API when creating a token to set an expiration. The `refresh_token_expires_in` has a default value of 30 days, but can be adjusted through the API.

**Note**: The `refresh_token` flow does not impact Zendesk Integration Services (ZIS) flows. No mandatory token expirations are enforced that could disrupt ZIS functionality. Although you can set `expires_in` for testing in non-ZIS OAuth use cases, ZIS does not currently support or require this.

### [](#client-credentials-grant-type) Client credentials grant type

The OAuth client credentials grant type is intended only for confidential clients and enables creating an OAuth token using just the client’s secret. To use this flow, send a request to the `/oauth/tokens` endpoint with `grant_type: client_credentials` and a valid `client_secret` parameter to generate a new access token. Unlike other authorization flows, this grant type does not return a refresh token and does not require user authorization. The token’s user will be the one associated with the client. You can optionally include an `expires_in` value to set the token’s expiration time in milliseconds. For security reasons, public clients are not allowed to use this grant type.

### [](#json-format) JSON format

OAuth Tokens for Grant Types are represented as JSON objects with the following properties:

| Name                     | Type    | Read-only | Mandatory | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

#### [](#example) Example

### [](#create-token-for-grant-type) Create Token for Grant Type

- `POST /oauth/tokens`

Returns an OAuth access token in exchange for an [authorization code](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203663836#topic_pvr_ncl_1l)
valid for 120 seconds.

Using a Zendesk username and password to gain an OAuth access token (password grant type flow) has been deprecated and is highly discouraged.

An access token can be revoked. Use the [OAuth Tokens API](/api-reference/ticketing/oauth/oauth_tokens)
to list, show, or revoke tokens.

#### [](#request-parameters) Request parameters

The POST request takes the following parameters, which must be formatted as JSON:

**Example Node.js authorization code grant flow**

**Example Node.js refresh token grant flow**

#### [](#scope) Scope

You must specify a scope to control the app's access to Zendesk resources. The "read" scope gives access to GET endpoints. It includes permission to sideload related resources. The "write" scope gives access to POST, PUT, and DELETE endpoints for creating, updating, and deleting resources.

**Note**: Don't confuse the **scope** parameter (singular) with the **scopes** parameter (plural) for non-grant-type tokens described in [OAuth Tokens](/api-reference/ticketing/oauth/oauth_tokens)
.

The "impersonate" scope allows a Zendesk admin to make requests on behalf of end users. See [Making API requests on behalf of end users](/documentation/ticketing/using-the-zendesk-api/making-api-requests-on-behalf-of-end-users/)
.

For example, the following parameter gives read access to all resources:

`"scope": "read"`

The following parameter gives read and write access to all resources:

`"scope": "read write"`

You can fine-tune the scope of the following resources:

- tickets
- users
- auditlogs (read only)
- organizations
- hc
- apps
- triggers
- automations
- targets
- webhooks

The syntax is as follows:

`"scope": "resource:scope"`

For example, the following parameter restricts the scope to only reading tickets:

`"scope": "tickets:read"`

To give read and write access to a resource, specify both scopes:

`"scope": "users:read users:write"`

To give write access only to one resource, such as organizations, and read access to everything else:

`"scope": "organizations:write read"`

**Note**: The endpoint returns an access token even if you specify an invalid scope such as `"scope": ["read", "write"]` (no parentheses). Any request you make with the token will return a "Forbidden" error.

### [](#create-token) Create Token

- `POST /api/v2/oauth/tokens`

Returns an OAuth access token with a specified [scope](#scopes)

Refresh tokens aren't used. An access token doesn't expire but it can be [revoked](#revoke-token)
.

For a tutorial, see [Creating and using OAuth tokens with the API](/documentation/ticketing/working-with-oauth/creating-and-using-oauth-tokens-with-the-api/)
.

**Note**: For OAuth authorization code, use the [Create Token for Grant Type](/api-reference/ticketing/oauth/grant_type_tokens/#create-token-for-grant-type)
endpoint. The two APIs don't share the same path, JSON format, or request parameters. However, both APIs return access tokens that can be used to [authenticate API requests](/api-reference/ticketing/introduction/#oauth-access-token)
.

#### [](#allowed-for-2) Allowed For

- Admins

#### [](#request-parameters) Request parameters

The POST request takes a "token" object that contains an OAuth client's resource id and scopes.

| Name      | Type    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| --------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| client_id | integer | The resource `id` of an [OAuth client](/api-reference/ticketing/oauth/oauth_clients/#json-format) (not the client's unique identifier). For the ids, see [List Clients](/api-reference/ticketing/oauth/oauth_clients/#list-clients) |
| scopes    | array   | Valid scopes for the token. See [Scopes](#scopes) below                                                                                                                                                                             |

#### [](#scopes) Scopes

The **scopes** parameter defines whether requests authenticated with the token can post, put, and delete data, or only get data.

**Note**: Don't confuse the **scopes** parameter (plural) with the **scope** parameter (singular) for [grant-type tokens](/api-reference/ticketing/oauth/grant_type_tokens/)
.

The **scopes** parameter is an array of strings, each specifying a resource name and an access setting. Access is either "read" or "write". If you don't specify a resource, access to all resources is assumed. If you don't specify the access, read and write access are assumed.

The syntax is as follows:

`"scopes": [resource:scope, ...]`

where `resource` is optional.

**Examples**

`"scopes": ["read"]`

`"scopes": ["tickets:read"]`

To give read and write access to a resource, specify both scopes:

`"scopes": ["users:read", "users:write"]`

To give write access only to one resource and read access to everything else:

`"scopes": ["organizations:write", "read"]`

**Note**: The endpoint returns an access token even if you specify an invalid scope. Any request you make with the token will return a "Forbidden" error.

**Available scopes**

- `read` - gives access to GET endpoints. Includes

permission to sideload related resources

- `write` - gives access to POST, PUT, and DELETE endpoints
- `impersonate` - allows Zendesk Support admins to make requests on behalf of

end users. See [Making API requests on behalf of end users](/documentation/ticketing/using-the-zendesk-api/making-api-requests-on-behalf-of-end-users/)

**Resources that can be scoped**

- tickets
- users
- auditlogs (read only)
- organizations
- hc
- apps
- triggers
- automations
- targets
- webhooks
- macros
- requests
- satisfaction_ratings
- dynamic_content

================================================
Brands are your customer-facing identities. They might represent multiple products or services, or they might literally be multiple brands owned and represented by your company.

The default brand is the one that tickets get assigned to if the ticket is generated from a non-branded channel. You can update the default brand using the [Update Account Settings](/api-reference/ticketing/account-configuration/account_settings/#update-account-settings)
endpoint.

### [](#json-format) JSON format

================================================
**Important:** Zendesk is [discontinuing support for URL targets and branded targets](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/6468124845210-Announcing-the-deprecation-of-URL-targets-and-branded-targets)
in favor of webhooks. From October 28, 2024, existing URL targets and branded targets will no longer function. There will be no change to Email targets.

Targets are pointers to cloud-based applications and services such as X (formerly Twitter) and Twilio, as well as to HTTP and email addresses. You can use targets with triggers and automations to send a notification to the target when a ticket is created or updated. For a list of targets, see [Notifying external targets](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203662136)
.

To specify a target notification as an action for a trigger or automation, use the action's `notification_target` field. The field's value is an array of two strings specifying the numeric ID of the target and the message body. Example:

For more information, see [Triggers](/api-reference/ticketing/business-rules/triggers/)
or [Automations](/api-reference/ticketing/business-rules/automations/)
.

### [](#json-format) JSON format

# https://developer.zendesk.com/api-reference/ticketing/jira/jira/ - Jira Integration API | Zendesk Developer Docszendev_horizontalzendev_horizontal with metadata date undefined

================================================
The official [Jira integration service](https://www.zendesk.com/apps/support/jira/)
by Zendesk provides a streamlined collaboration experience for your support and engineering teams by bringing Zendesk Support and Jira together. The integration service consists of a Zendesk Support app, a Jira app, and a middleware that provides backend functionalities and data storage for apps. The Jira Integration API allows further customization of the integration to fit your particular requirements.

## [](#authentication) Authentication

The Jira Integration API is part of the Zendesk API. It allows an authenticated admin user to view and create links between your Jira and Zendesk instances. Authentication works as described in the [the Zendesk API introduction](/api-reference/introduction/security-and-auth/)
.

### [](#run-in-postman) Run in Postman

If you use Postman, you can import the Jira Integration API endpoints as a collection into your Postman app, then try out different requests to learn how the API works. Click the following button to get started:

[](https://god.gw.postman.com/run-collection/19931619-3c845a75-ae99-4b13-92bc-1f06d6776e34?action=collection/fork&collection-url=entityId=19931619-3c845a75-ae99-4b13-92bc-1f06d6776e34&entityType=collection&workspaceId=cfe0e8e6-42d1-4f46-a048-90e2caae5a05)

If you don't use Postman, you can sign up for a free account on the [Postman website](https://identity.getpostman.com/signup)
and download the app. For more information about using Postman with Zendesk APIs, see [Exploring Zendesk APIs with Postman](/documentation/api-basics/working-with-the-zendesk-apis/exploring-zendesk-apis-with-postman/)
.

# https://developer.zendesk.com/api-reference/ticketing/jira/links/ - Links | Zendesk Developer Docszendev_horizontalzendev_horizontal with metadata date undefined

================================================
A link is the connection between a Jira issue and a Zendesk ticket. You can use this API to list, create, and delete links.

### [](#json-format) JSON format

Links are represented as JSON objects with the following properties:

| Name       | Type    | Read-only | Mandatory | Description                                     |
| ---------- | ------- | --------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| created_at | string  | true      | false     | The time at which the link was created          |
| id         | integer | true      | false     | Automatically assigned when the link is created |
| issue_id   | string  | false     | true      | The id of the Jira issue                        |
| issue_key  | string  | false     | true      | The key for the Jira issue                      |
| ticket_id  | string  | false     | true      | The id of the Zendesk ticket                    |
| updated_at | string  | true      | false     | The time at which the link was last updated     |
| url        | string  | false     | false     | An url to get the link details                  |

The Jira integration uses `issue_id` to identify an issue. `issue_id` is used over `issue_key` because `issue_id` is immutable. An `issue_key` might change after an issue is moved to a different project. You can get an issue's ID using the instructions [here](https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirakb/how-to-get-issue-id-from-the-jira-user-interface-827341428.html)
or via the Jira REST API: [Cloud](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/#api-api-2-issue-issueIdOrKey-get)
, [Server](https://developer.atlassian.com/server/jira/platform/rest-apis/)
.

`issue_key` is also mandatory because it is used to support syncing issue keys to tickets. You can read more about the field sync feature [here](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004257108-Using-the-JIRA-field-syncing-feature)
.

# https://developer.zendesk.com/api-reference/ticketing/side_conversation/side_conversation/ - Side Conversations | Zendesk Developer Docszendev_horizontalzendev_horizontal with metadata date undefined

================================================
Side conversations allow agents to send an email to somebody outside the main conversation in a ticket and keep the email messages within the ticket. See [Using side conversations in tickets](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001263308)
in the Support Help Center.

Agents can also initiate a side conversation in Slack or Microsoft Teams and keep all the messages in the ticket. See [Using Slack in side conversations](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002115087)
or [Using Micosoft Teams in side conversations](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/5191537451290)
.

The messages that make up a side conversation are recorded as events. See [Side Conversation Events](/api-reference/ticketing/side_conversation/side_conversation_event/)
.

The Collaboration add-on is required for side conversations. See [About add-ons (Professional and Enterprise)](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/217547487)
.

- `POST /api/v2/apps/notify`

Sends messages to currently open instances of a Zendesk Apps framework (ZAF) app. The messages cause an event to fire in the app. For example, you could use this API in conjunction with a custom ZAF app to send critical product information to all signed-in agents. For information on how to set up custom event handlers, see [Notification events](/api-reference/apps/apps-support-api/all_locations/#notification-events)
in the ZAF docs.

| Name     | Type    | Mandatory | Comment                                                             |
| -------- | ------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| app_id   | integer | yes       | The id of the app you want to send the message to                   |
| event    | string  | yes       | The name of the event you want to fire in your app                  |
| body     | string  | no        | If it's valid JSON, it's passed to your app as a JavaScript object. |
| agent_id | integer | no        | Send the notification to only one agent                             |

For example, to send a user's updated phone number to agent #534 using the app with an id of 375, the request body might look something like this:

#### [](#installation-settings) Installation settings

All apps support the "name" installation setting. App developers can define other installation settings using the app's manifest file. For more information about defining installation settings, see [Defining installation settings](/documentation/apps/app-developer-guide/setup/#defining-installation-settings)
.

You specify installation setting values using the `settings` or `settings_objects` properties. `settings` formats the settings as a flat object. `settings_objects` formats the settings as an array of objects.

You must specify at least one installation setting value in `settings`. If you specify a setting value in both `settings` and `settings_objects`, only the value in `settings` is used.

#### [](#app-requirements) App requirements

If the app has [requirements](/documentation/apps/app-developer-guide/apps_requirements/)
, the API response includes a job ID you can use to poll the installation status. See [Get Requirements Install Status](#get-requirements-install-status)
. Example:

#### [](#disabling-apps-on-installation) Disabling apps on installation

By default, apps are enabled upon installation. To install an app and immediately disable it, pass `"enabled": false` in the install request.

and the app has [requirements](/documentation/apps/app-developer-guide/apps_requirements/)
, this endpoint returns the status of the requirements installation. The job id is supplied in the response to the app installation request.

If the `status` is "completed", the installation has been created successfully with its requirements, and is available for use.

If the `status` is "failed" check the message for the reason.

If you're constantly getting the same error message and the error message isn't clear, try installing the app with the Zendesk Support user interface before contacting [Zendesk Customer Support](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360026614173)

================================================

# https://developer.zendesk.com/api-reference/introduction/rate-limits/ - Rate limits | Zendesk Developer Docszendev_horizontalzendev_horizontal with metadata date undefined

================================================
Requests to the Zendesk Support API may be subject to the following limits:

- [Monitoring your request activity](#monitoring-your-request-activity)
- [Zendesk Suite plan limits](#zendesk-suite-plan-limits)
- [Zendesk Support plan limits](#zendesk-support-plan-limits)
- [Endpoint rate limits](#endpoint-rate-limits)
- [External Content API limits](#external-content-api-limits)
- [Offset pagination limits](#offset-pagination-limits)
- [Job limit](#job-limit)
- [Apps rate limit](#apps-rate-limit)
- [Account limit](#account-limit)

Notwithstanding the limits specified in this document, the system might still limit requests if it detects an unusual spike in requests from all sources for the account, including internal product requests. For example, this can happen in a denial-of-service attack. See [Account limit](#account-limit)
.

### [](#monitoring-your-request-activity) Monitoring your request activity

You can compare your request activity in the last 24 hours against your rate limit. See [Monitoring API usage against your rate limit](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408836402074-Managing-API-usage-in-your-Zendesk-account#topic_gfl_mz4_jyb)
.

You can use the following response headers to confirm the account's current rate limit and monitor the number of requests remaining in the current minute:

If the rate limit is exceeded, the API responds with a [429 Too Many Requests](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/429)
status code. The response also has a `Retry-After` header that tells you how many seconds to wait before retrying API requests. Ensure your code handles 429 errors and waits the `Retry-After` interval before retrying requests.

For tips on avoiding and handling 429 errors, see [Best practices for avoiding rate limiting](/documentation/ticketing/using-the-zendesk-api/best-practices-for-avoiding-rate-limiting/)
.

#### [](#monitoring-the-request-activity-of-ticketing-apis) Monitoring the request activity of Ticketing APIs

Ticketing APIs such as the Tickets API and the Users API have additional rate limit headers in their responses. The headers provide more information about the account's current rate limit and the number of requests remaining in the current minute. The 429 errors described above also apply to these responses.

For examples of how you can use the rate limit information, see [Using rate limit headers in your application](/documentation/ticketing/using-the-zendesk-api/best-practices-for-avoiding-rate-limiting/#using-rate-limit-headers-in-your-application)
.

### [](#zendesk-suite-plan-limits) Zendesk Suite plan limits

The following limits apply depending on your Zendesk Suite plan type. Not all rate limits are covered in this table. Make sure to also check the documentation for the specific endpoint for complete details.

### [](#zendesk-support-plan-limits) Zendesk Support plan limits

The following Support, Help Center, and Custom Objects API rate limits apply on your Zendesk Support plan type.

| Plan                                              | Requests per minute |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Essential (legacy)                                | 10                  |
| Team                                              | 200                 |
| Professional                                      | 400                 |
| Enterprise                                        | 700                 |
| [High Volume API add-on](#high-volume-api-add-on) | 2500                |

The rate limits for the Help Center API are the same as for the Support API. However, requests to the Help Center API don't count against the rate limit of the Support API, and conversely.

#### [](#high-volume-api-add-on) High Volume API add-on

The High Volume add-an increases a qualifying plan's limit to 2500 requests per minute to the Support and Help Center APIs. It doesn't add an additional 2500 requests to the plan's limit.

The add-on is available on the Zendesk Suite Growth plan and above, and the Zendesk Support Professional plan and above. You must have a minimum of 10 [agent seats](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408834934554)
to purchase this add-on. The add-on is not required on the Zendesk Suite Enterprise Plus plan because the plan has a built-in rate limit of 2500.

Subject to Zendesk’s prior written consent, Zendesk may allow you to increase API usage limits beyond 2500 requests per minute for an additional fee.

### [](#endpoint-rate-limits) Endpoint rate limits

Some endpoints have their own rate limit. For example, the Update Ticket endpoint has a rate limit of 30 updates to the same ticket by the same agent within a 10-minute period. Zendesk reserves the right to adjust the rate limit for given endpoints to provide a high quality of service for all clients.

Help Center API rate limits apply to searches performed through the Help Center API, but they do not apply to searches performed through the UI.

| Description              | Limit                  |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| External record creation | 770 records per minute |
| External record size     | 10000 bytes per record |
| External sources         | 20                     |
| External types           | 20                     |

### [](#offset-pagination-limits) Offset pagination limits

API requests that use offset pagination are subject to limits as described in [Pagination](/api-reference/introduction/pagination/#offset-pagination-limit)
.

### [](#job-limit) Job limit

Some endpoints such as the [Update Many Tickets](/api-reference/ticketing/tickets/tickets/#update-many-tickets)
endpoint queue background jobs to do the work. You can have up to 30 queued or running jobs at once. If you exceed the limit, you will receive a "TooManyJobs" error. Example:

### [](#apps-rate-limit) Apps rate limit

API requests made by [Zendesk apps](/documentation/apps/)
are subject to an additional rate limit of 100 requests per minute per user per app at the client level, and 700 calls per 5 minutes per user per app at the API level.

### [](#account-limit) Account limit

Zendesk might limit requests if it detects an unusual spike in requests from all sources for the account, including internal product requests. For example, this can happen in a denial-of-service attack. The account-wide limit is 100,000 requests per minute.
